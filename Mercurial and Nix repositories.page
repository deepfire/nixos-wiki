Mercurial and nixos/nixpkgs
---------------------------

You are less than 30 years old and really can't get into non-distributed
VCS? Then this page might be what you're looking for!

### Installing Mercurial and hgsubversion

     nix-env -i mercurial

     nix-env -i hgsubversion

(hgsubversion will be hopefully soon available via nix...)

### Configuring Mercurial to use hgsubversion

-   EDIT \~/.hgrc

<!-- -->

     [ui]
     username = Firstname Lastname <email>
     verbose = True

     [extensions]
     hgext.convert=
     rebase=
     svn=~/.nix-profile/lib/python2.6/hgsubversion

-   SAVE and QUIT (only the extensions part is important here)
-   check that everuthing is ok:

     $ hg version --svn

     hgsubversion: 1.1.2+101-bfb88a304ebe
     Subversion: 1.6.12
     bindings: Subvertpy 0.7.4

### Cloning the nixpkgs vn repository

This \*WILL\* take a \*LONG\* time (about 10-20 minutes)

     $ mkdir -p ~/some/path/
     $ cd ~/some/path
     $ hg clone https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk nixpkgs-hg

-   Once done you \*MUST\* ensure that all file permissions are the same
    (mercurial will apply commits from the beginning of the history to
    the latest revision to rebuild the tree, "forgetting" about file
    permissions in the way).
-   Failing to do so will result in binaries incompatibilities between
    derivations from your tree and derivations from official
    nixpkgs/trunk (and by consequence the inability to use binaries
    built by hydra, i.e. you'll need to re-bootstrap your nixos
    entierely). Worst to \*inability\* to bootstrap the system, because
    the files in question should really have the executable flag
    activated.
-   In my case the only files with wrong permissions were those
    executable needed for bootstrapping the system (sic!).
-   Make sure that at least those files have these permissions (notice
    the executable flag).

### Staying up to date

     $ hg pull

### Diffs between svn and your version

     $ hg diff --svn -r<hg LOCAL revision>

(will show the svn revision of modified files)

### Commit to svn (not tested!)

     $ hg push
