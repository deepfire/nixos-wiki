TODO: This page should be merged with [Haskell](//Haskell).

Hack-nix is an alternative way packaging most of hackage for Nix.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nixpkgs-haskell-overlay&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Introduction")] Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hackage and cabal files are the standard to define build dependencies of
Haskell packages. There are almost no exceptions left using different
build systems (configure make or the like). Because version constraints
defined in such cabal files can become quite complex its very annoying
to build many haskell dependencies then to see that you did something
very wrong because cabal of the target package fails to resolve
dependencies because you choose wrong versions. (Things got better due
to the Haskell platform - hack-nix was started before it existed.)
Hack-nix tries to solve these kind of issues by making Nix choose the
correct versions from a pool of hackage packages - doing almost the same
analysis cabal would do.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nixpkgs-haskell-overlay&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: How does hack-nix work?")] How does hack-nix work?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's best explained by the workflow:

1)

       hack-nix # no args

loads the hackage package dump and applies some
[patches](https://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay/tree/master/patches).
This pool of packages is written in a
[hack-nix-db.nix](https://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay/blob/master/hackage/hack-nix-db.nix)
readable by Nix.

Examples like darcs (having more than 8 flags) illustrate easily why
there are too many possibilities to judge which is why the default flag
settings are used but can be overridden easily. See darcs example
forcing cabal flags curl, http etc to be true: [default.nix of
nixpkgs-haskell-overlay](https://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay/blob/master/default.nix).

Its also easy to imagine how many different dependency graphs could be
evaluated. Think about the dependency tree:

      A -  C .
        `- B  -  TARGET

TARGET is the executable you want to build, and C, B are libraries like
"curl" or "bytestring".

Now imagine that there are 3 versions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2) on hackage for C
and B and TARGET can be build with all 9 combinations. You can easily
imagine how many ways there exists to build a package.

The simple prototype brute force solver can't cope with it. it would
require too much time and memory. (NAT solvers might solve this. Eclipse
equinox p2 does this - but it would be a lot more work to implement)
That's why only the latest package versions and some manually selected
older package versions found on hackage are used to make up the default
pool (hack-nix-db.nix).

Creating this dump requires hashes of all source archives. Contact me
(see bottom) to get a file with most hashes.

2)

The brute force solver written in Nix reads the pool. While doing so
additional packages such as dev versions can be added, too. Then the
solver either fails early telling you that some constraints couldn't be
satisfied or nix builds your packages. If dependencies are missing very
often its enough to rebuild the dump adding some additional older
versions.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nixpkgs-haskell-overlay&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: INSTALLATION")] INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      mkdir hack-nix; cd hack-nix
      git clone --depth=1 git://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs -b experimental/hack-nix
      git clone --depth=1  git://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay.git

Way 1 to run the solver: See exeByName definitions in the [default.nix
of the
overlay](https://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay/blob/master/default.nix).
You can build everything easily. Example: Building hack-nix executable
(which you'll require for way 2 anyway):

     nix-build -A hackNix nixpkgs-haskell-overlay/default.nix

 WAY 2 to run the solver:

      cd YOUR_CABAL_PROJECT # which you want to build
      hack-nix --build-env

      # or to build a specific configuration:
      hack-nix --write-hack-nix-cabal-config
      # adjust to your liking:
      $EDITOR .hack-nix-cabal-config
      hack-nix --build-env-name NAME_OF_BUILD_CONFIGURATION

This will create a shell script which if loaded contains everything you
need to build YOUR\_CABAL\_PROJECT. Editing the .hack-nix-cabal-config
you can add packages to the pool, change ghc version etc. This way you
can build the same package in different shells using different shell
environment settings easily testing different cabal flags or ghc
versions.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nixpkgs-haskell-overlay&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: TIPS")] TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP 1)

      hack-nix --patch-workflow name-version

can be used to create patches patches for nixpkgs-haskell-overlay easily
Most of the time they are used to change very tight constraints written
in cabal files.

TIP 2)

The \~/hack-nix/config file can be edited making hack-nix also generate
hasktags tag files for you. Eg put this code into your \~/.vimrc file to
use them:

     fun! AddTagsFromEnv()
       let tags = split(&tags,',')
       for i in split(expand('$buildInputs'),'\s\+')
         call extend(tags, split(glob(i.'/src/*/*_tags'),"\n"))
       endfor
       call extend(tags, split($TAG_FILES,":"))
       call filter(tags, 'filereadable(v:val)')
       for t in tags
         if &tags !~ substitute(t, '/','\\/','g')
           exec "set tags+=".t
         endif
       endfor
     endf
     " the following two lines are for github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-haskell
     let g:vim_addon_haskell = {}
     let g:vim_addon_haskell.env_reloaded_hook_fun = 'AddTagsFromEnv'
     call AddTagsFromEnv()

TIP 3) The README files of the github repositories may contain some
additional information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depends on you. Peter and Andreas Loeh has shown with their traditional
way that the problems I saw do not happen in practice.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Nixpkgs-haskell-overlay&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: BUGS")] BUGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, there are many. build tools were not defined by cabal files in the
past which is why tools like happy have to added as buildinputs manually
(see default.nix file of the overlay). If you have 2 month of free time
- what about implementing NAT for finding solutions for the dependency
trees?

hack-nix is not very friendly to new users. If you have any questions

I did something similar for rubyforge and PyPi.
