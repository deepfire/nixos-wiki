I have a netbook which I use to connect to my WPA2-protected wifi
network at home. Here is my experience of setting up wicd and wireless
connection.

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=WICD&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Check the hardware")] Check the hardware

Check that your wireless adapter is working

    [root@pokemon:~]# ifconfig -a | grep -A 5 wlan
    wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:16:EB:19:DC:A0  
              BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
              RX packets:25756 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
              TX packets:22685 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
              RX bytes:7196191 (6.8 Mb)  TX bytes:7611727 (7.2 Mb)

If not, consult dmesg. One possible reason is missing firmware.
Sometimes you may need to enable it explicitly, see
networking.enableIntel2100BGFirmware option as an example.

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=WICD&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Enable wicd, disable other networking")] Enable wicd, disable other networking

Wicd is fully-functional network manager, it takes responsibility for
connecting, launching dhcp clients, storing passwords, etc. To prevent
conflicts, disable other network agents

    networking = {
      ...
      interfaceMonitor.enable = false;
      wireless.enable = false; # Don't run wpa_supplicant (wicd will do it when necessary)
      useDHCP = false; # Don't run dhclient on wlan0
      wicd.enable = true;
      ...
    };

(Roconnor 2012-08-13: setting useDHCP to false breaks for me in that
wicd never sets the DNS server. Sergey 2013-06: confirm, that seems to
be a dhcpcd issue. Wicd better works with dhclient.)

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=WICD&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Setup wicd")] Setup wicd

Now rebuild nixos, switch to new configuration and launch the gui.

    $ wicd-gtk

Notes:

-   If it doesn't see wireless networks, open preferences and check
    wireless interface name. Enter correct value (like "wlan0") if
    needed.
-   Currently, wicd works better with dhclient backend rather than with
    dhcpcd. dhclient can be enabled in the 'External programs' tab.

That's it. Now use gui to find your network, enter passwords and connect
to it.
