Leave a comment here if you are interested in attending a
[hackfest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) or participating
remotely. Include your name or nick and mention what you would like to
work on in particular. Try to include some detail if the topic requires
an introduction for others, pointers to mailing list discussions,
tickets etc. could also be helpful. We don't all have to work on the
same thing, but it is good to take advantage of having people around to
flesh things out.

Improve python support
----------------------

Work on solving some of the following issues

-   Python package impurity (stop packages from trying to install
    dependencies)
-   Run the package tests (currently most of them are disabled because
    they don't work)
-   Write nix tests which test that the python modules work (to some
    degree)
-   Look at generating nix expressions from pypi (see MarcWeber's work
    on this)
