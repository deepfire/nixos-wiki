This tutorial (will) describe how to install NixOS as a guest OS via
Virtualbox, and specifically on getting a GUI up and running. Many parts
of it are likely not specific to Macs, but nevertheless that is the
focus of this article.

I am on a 64-bit MacBook Pro, so on 32-bit systems modifications may be
neccesary.

TODO Setup VM
-------------

### Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is available from <http://www.virtualbox.org/>. Installing it
should be more or less straightforward.

### Create VM

Open the VirtualBox application and create a new VM, which will bring up
the "New Virtual Machine Wizard".
