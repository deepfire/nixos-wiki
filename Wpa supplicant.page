Wireless networking
===================

NixOS' uses wpa\_supplicant for wireless networking. This article
describes how to configure NixOS to use wpa\_supplicant and to connect
to a variety of wireless networks.

Configuration
-------------

To enable wireless networking add the following attribute to your
`configuration.nix` and reconfigure your system.

    networking.wireless.enable = true;

You should already have set `networking.hostName` and it might be
mandatory for wireless networking to have this set. (Is this true?)

It might also be a good idea to enable a firewall by setting
`networking.firewall.enable = true;`. (Explain pros and cons.)

Prerequisites
-------------

Before proceeding make sure to check whether your wireless network card
has properly been recognized. You can check this by issuing `iwconfig`
and you should see a wireless extension being reported for `wlan0`.

### Scan for wireless networks

To scan for wireless networks in range you can use the following
command.

    iwlist wlan0 scan

Wirless networks
----------------

Configuration of wireless networks is being done in
`/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`. This file is readable and writable by root
only so make sure to have root privileges before editing. Since this
file contains plain passwords for wireless networks you shouldn't
attempt to make this file readable by any other account than root.

The file `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` contains a lot of configuration and
documentation already. However, these are sensible default values which
should work in most cases. As of now don't touch them unless something
isn't working as expected or you know what you are doing.

To the end of the file you can describe the wireless networks you want
to connect to. In most cases you only need to specify a *essid* and a
*passphrase*. To add a wireless network called `mynetwork` with
passphrase `mysecretpass` add the following contents to the end of the
file `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

    network={
      ssid="mynetwork"
      psk="mysecretpassphrase"
    }

You now should reconfigure your system again and wpa\_supplicant should
take care of automatically getting you connected as soon as you are in
range for any of the networks specified in `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

You don't need the human-readable passphrase stored in
`/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`:

`wpa_passphrase 'mynetwork' 'mysecretpassphrase' | grep -v '#psk="' >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf`

This will append to `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` something like this:

    network={
           ssid="mynetwork"
           psk=d2b1d5f68ef2c2b04a89361f0722e65a1591de6d82b979d03fabf501c4356589
    }

### Insecure wireless networks

To connect to a wireless network named `insecureNetwork` which isn't
secured by a passphrase use the following configuration.

    network={
     ssid="insecureNetwork"
     key_mgmt=NONE
    }
