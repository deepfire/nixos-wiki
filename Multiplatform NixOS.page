Overview
========

The current supported platforms are:

-   PC (i686-linux, x86\_64-linux)
-   Sheevaplug (armv5tel-linux)
-   Fuloong Mini-PC (mips64, with mips n32 binaries)
-   [Raspberry Pi](//Raspberry Pi)

Fuloong Mini-PC
===============

Installation
------------

I will describe the procedure to install NixOS through the network,
although a bootable USB could work.

Requirements:

-   A TFTP server
-   An NFS server
-   Download the *system tarball* (magnet url:
    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:d8b6179c79f5defa3102dd6cb11ded1f876050b9&dn=nixos-system-mips64el-linux-86c1e10-86e5e52.tar.xz)
    and unpack it somewhere accessible by the NFS client you will have
    in your Fuloong Mini-PC. You can use an 'exports' like:

<!-- -->

    /home/fuloongroot 192.168.1.0/24(rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash)

Procedure:

In the PC, lets prepare the files you will serve by NFS

-   Read the `kernel-parameters.txt`. Notice there is a mention to an
    `init-stage2.sh` file and a `system` directory, both in the store
    path.
-   Make symbolic links to those paths in /boot/init and /boot/system.
    Something like this:

<!-- -->

    ln -s /nix/store/41x8chz5mwf3nwxd7460skz291fyvml7-stage-2-init.sh boot/init
    ln -s /nix/store/rmc2a3w0c10rwhad7493scqcrh5b0dkc-system boot/system

-   Disable the start of dhclient, editing
    nix/store/\*upstart-dhclient.conf and commenting the line starting
    with "start on"
-   Copy the file boot/vmlinux to your TFTP server root

In the Fuloong2f:

-   Boot PMON (turn on the computer), and enter its command line mode
    using a USB keyboard and pressing at boot time the DELETE key. You
    will get a prompt.
-   Give your system an IP (use 'devls' to know about your NIC device
    name)

<!-- -->

    ifaddr rtk0 192.168.1.223

-   Get the kernel through tftp, where TFTPIP is your tftp server ip

<!-- -->

    load tftp://TFTPIP/vmlinux

-   Boot the kernel, where NFSIP:NFSPATH is your nfsroot mount point,
    and IP is the ip of your computer

<!-- -->

    g console=tty nfsroot=NFSIP:NFSPATH root=/dev/nfs ip=IP init=/boot/init systemConfig=/boot/system

After this, you will have a running NixOS. Nevertheless, here are some
details you will still need:

In order to use nix-env in that nfsroot, you will need to setup your
\~/.nixpkgs/config.nix file to set the platform you want the packages
for:

    pkgs:
    {
      platform = pkgs.platforms.fuloong2f_n32;
    }

Additionally, you will need to checkout the following *nixos* and
*nixpkgs* to work properly in the fuloong:

    cd /etc/nixos
    svn co https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixos/branches/stdenv-updates nixos
    svn co https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/branches/stdenv-updates nixpkgs

After this you can proceed installing programs or installing NixOS with
the usual `nixos-install` procedures as described in the [NixOS
manual](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk/manual/latest/download)
installing from a bootable CD.

You may want to use this channel:

    nix-pull http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/tmp/nix/fuloongchannel/MANIFEST

Configuration details
---------------------

In your `configuration.nix`, you have to pay attention to these basics
to get a bootable system.

We are going to use the *generationsDir* boot method, that simply puts
the necessary files to load into known paths inside `/boot`. You will
have to configure your usual PMON `/boot/boot.cfg` pointing to those
paths. Here is an excerpt of my manually written `/boot/boot.cfg` (which
resides in *hda1*, while my nixos is in *hda2*):

    timeout 3
    default 0
    showmenu 1

    title nixos
            kernel /dev/fs/ext2@wd0b/boot/nixos-kernel
            initrd /dev/fs/ext2@wd0b/boot/nixos-initrd
            args console=tty root=/dev/hda2 init=/boot/default/init selinux=0 systemConfig=/boot/default/system

I will type the `configuration.nix` attributes involved in the shortest
form. If I write boot.loader, it does not mean 'loader' should be the
only attribute of boot. It's up to your configuration.

Switch on the *generationsDir* bootloader:

    boot.loader = {
      grub.enable = false;
      generationsDir = {
        enable = true;
        copyKernels = true;  # if you don't want store path references, but references to files in /boot
      };
    };

Use a recent kernel:

    boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_2_6_35;

You have to tell nixpkgs that you have a fuloong mini-pc system. So you
need:

    nixpkgs.config.platform = pkgs.platforms.fuloong2f_n32;

You will also need that nixpkgs config option in your user nixpkgs
configuration, like \~/.nixpkgs/config.nix, to get nix-env and such
commands working fine:

    {
      platform = (import /etc/nixos/nixpkgs).platforms.fuloong2f_n32;
    }

To run the X server at boot time with the slim display manager, set this
in configuration.nix:

     xserver = {
       enable = true;
       videoDriver = "sis";
       moduleSection = ''
         Load "vbe"
       '';
     };

MANIFEST
--------

In order to install programs, you can get some precompiled binaries
using this MANIFEST:

    nix-pull http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/~viric/tmp/nix/fuloongchannel/MANIFEST

Support

irc.freenode.net\#nixos

Sheevaplug
==========

You can install a NixOS with a proceeding similar to that described for
the Fuloong. You can use this system tarball to start (it includes a
README on how to use it):
