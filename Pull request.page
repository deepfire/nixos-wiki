What is a github pull request ?
-------------------------------

Its a way to tell a github project that you've created some changes.
Maintainers can easily review, comment on and merge your changes.

How to create a git pull request
--------------------------------

1\) Create a github account. Create a new remote location:

       # add your github clone as remote location:
       YOUR_GITHUB_NAME=fill-in
       git remote add $YOUR_GITHUB_NAME "git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/nixpkgs.git"

2\) git commit your change

       git add FILE_LIST # eventually use git add --patch
       git commit

       # verify everything is ok - no unexpected dangling files git does not know about yet:
       git status

3\) submitting your change, push to your repository:

       # recommended: create a topic branch, so that this change
       # can be submitted independently from other patches:
       git checkout -tb submit/your-topic-name
       git push $YOUR_GITHUB_NAME submit/your-topic-name

goto gituhb.com/your\_name -\> create pull request

Why create your own branch? You can follow upstream (master) by running
"git merge master". You can "git commit --amend" fixes and "git push -f"
your branch. You can always switch back to master by "git checkout
master".

For long living topic branches you may want to read
[Nixpkgs\_and\_TopGit](//Nixpkgs and TopGit) which allows to squash many
changes so that patches will always be easy to review.
