Vimprobable
===========

Vimprobable is a web browser that behaves like the [Vimperator
plugin](http://www.vimperator.org/) available for Mozilla Firefox. It is
based on the WebKit engine (using GTK bindings). The goal of Vimprobable
is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and pleasurable
browsing-experience. Its featureset might be considered "minimalistic",
but not as minimalistic as being completely featureless.

Vimprobable is available in two versions, that is vimprobable and
vimprobable2. As of now only vimprobable2 is available and vimprobable
will be used synonymously with vimprobable2 from now on.

Installation
------------

    $ nix-env -i vimprobable2

Configuration
-------------

vimprobable looks for configuration files in
`$HOME/.config/vimprobable`. The basic configuration is done in
`vimprobablerc`. To create this file issue the following commands.

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/vimprobable
    $ touch $HOME/.config/vimprobable/vimprobablerc

See `man vimprobablerc` for configuration options.

### Search engines

vimprobable can be configured to use a variety of search engines. A
benefit from configuring a search engine is that you can use them for
URLs. For example you can just type `g NixOS` to search for *NixOS* on
Google. The following example sets up the search engines Google
(shortcut `g`), Wikipedia (shortcut `w`) and NixOS wiki (shortcut `wn`).

    $ touch $HOME/.config/vimprobable/searchengines
    $ cat << EOF
    g  https://google.com/search?q=%s
    nw https://nixos.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s
    w  https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?search=%s
    $ EOF > $HOME/.config/vimprobable/searchengines

See `man vimprobable2` for default search engines that come with
vimprobable.

### Tab support

vimprobable doesn't offer tab support. However, you can use
[tabbed](http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed) for that. Install tabbed and
create an alias to vimprobable2 as following.

    $ nix-env -i tabbed

    $ alias vimprobable2="vimprobable2 -e \"\$(tabbed -d)\""

You can switch tabs by pressing `gt` or `gT`.
