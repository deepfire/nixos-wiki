This page is ment to be a long list command line applications and
functions that some people may not know how to use. For instance how to
pipe the output of a command to another command (ex. **lspci |grep
Network**). It is ment to be both a learning tool for bash,
nix-expressions and NixOS.

**Under construction**. As such this page does not yet need a structure
but is merely present so that it can be shared and edited by the
community.

**This page is a part of the [UDX Initiative](//UDX Initiative)** which
focuses on easily understood, simple and clear explanations and
documentation to ensure the least amount of communication faults between
User & Developer

### The Basics

A command line is a line of text which the user can write text in to run
applications and manipulate the environment and operating system, which
then usually outputs one, several or many lines of text to illustrate a
task or information in a systematic and structured way.

All commands in the command line have options to them signified by
either one line for short (**-v**) or two lines for the name of the
function (**--verbose**). When using verbose we are asking the command
to not filter or omit any information, but to give as much information
as possible (or to be *verbose*).

### Filtering Commands

#### *Cut* [[1]](http://man.he.net/?topic=cut&section=all)

**Cut** allows you to cut out certain bytes, characters and fields
provided by output.

*To cut away the rest of the characters in a line after **32**
characters*

**ls /nix/store/ |cut -c -32**

*To cut away the first **34** characters of a line:*

**ls /nix/store/ |cut -c 34-**
