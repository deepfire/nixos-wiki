How to use Nix to create Plone development environment
======================================================

All files can also be downloaded from following gist:
<https://gist.github.com/garbas/5293558>

In above gist there is also script called "install\_nix.sh" which might
help you with setting up Nix.

For rest of the steps It is assumed you already installed Nix on your
system.

Quickstart
----------

1\. Download gist from link above

2\. (optional) In case you don't have Nix install you can use
"install\_nix.sh" to install it.

3\. Run "make" in folder you extracted Gist files

4\. Depending on your connection (\~5min fast, \~20min slow) Plone 4.3
(at the time of writing this HowTo) will be installed. Start Plone with
"bin/instance fg".

What actually happened above?
-----------------------------

Gist from above contains few files:

    - buildout.cfg
    - plone.nix
    - Makefile

"buildout.cfg" is actually a normal buildout configuration file we are
used in Plone already. Only thing special about it that we have to pin
few eggs to specific versions (look at versions section).

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.3/versions.cfg
    eggs-directory = eggs
    versions = versions
    unzip = true
    parts =
    instance

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    debug-mode = on
    verbose-security = on
    eggs =
        Pillow
        Plone

    [versions]
    zc.buildout = 1.7.1
    distribute = 0.6.34

"plone.nix" is nix expression where we define which things should be
installed for us by nix. Expression below tells to use Python 2.7, Plone
and some other eggs which are listed under "paths".

    { }:

    let
        pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
    in

    with pkgs;

    buildEnv {
        name = "plone-env";
        paths = [
            python27
            python27Packages.distribute
            python27Packages.recursivePthLoader
            python27Packages.virtualenv
            plone43Packages.plone
            plone43Packages.pillow
            plone43Packages.mailinglogger
            plone43Packages.plone_recipe_zope2instance
            plone43Packages.zc_recipe_egg
        ] ++ lib.attrValues python27.modules;
    }

"Makefile". Convinient place to gather commands but essantially what
happends when you run make is:

1\. Download (if not already downloaded) all nix packages listed in
"plone.nix" and create profile in current folder called "nixenv". On
NixOS you don't need to export NIX\_PATH.

       NIX_PATH=~/.nix-defexpr/channels nix-build --out-link nixenv plone.nix

2\. Using virtualenv command which you installed from previous command
create python virtual environment.

       ./nixenv/bin/virtualenv --distribute --clear .

3\. Make sure virtual environment we created in previous step sees all
eggs we installed with nix (in step 1).

       echo ../../../nixenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages > lib/python2.7/site-packages/nixenv.pth

4\. Use this weird easy\_install feature that creates binaries if it
doesn't exists already even if egg is already installed.

       ./bin/easy_install -H "" zc.buildout

5\. "bin/buildout" command created in previous step and you use it like
you would with any other buildout installation.

       bin/buildout

6\. "bin/buildout" should create "bin/instance" or whatever you specified
in "buildout.cfg" and by running "bin/instance fg" you'll start Plone in
foreground mode.

       bin/instance fg

Conclusion
----------

Above example should work cross-platform on Darwin(OSX)/Linux/FreeBSD.
I(garbas) tested Linux and OSX 10.8.

How to use myEnvFun and buildout-nix to create a plone development environment
==============================================================================

1\. Add a myEnvFun expression for plone development to
\~/.nixpkgs/config.nix:

    {
     packageOverrides = pkgs: {
        plone43 = pkgs.myEnvFun {
          name = "plone43";
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [
            python27Packages."Plone-4.3.1"
            pythonFull # provides python standard library, readline etc.
            python27Packages.zc_buildout_nix
            stdenv # provides gcc for building python c extensions
         ];
        };

      };
    }

2\. Initialize the environment:

    $ load-env-plone43
    env-plone43 loaded

    plone43:[goibhniu@macha:~/Projects/Plone/plone.chat]$

3\. Create a buildout.cfg:

    [buildout]
    extends = http://dist.plone.org/release/4.3/versions.cfg
    eggs-directory = eggs
    versions = versions
    unzip = true
    parts = instance

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    user = admin:admin
    debug-mode = on
    verbose-security = on
    eggs =
        Plone

    [versions]
    distribute = 0.6.34
    # If you get any version conflict errors when running buildout, pin the version here
    zc.buildout = 2.2.0
    Zope2 = 2.13.20
    setuptools = 0.9.8
    ZConfig = 2.9.1
    zc.lockfile = 1.0.2
    zope.tales = 3.5.3
    pytz = 2013b
    docutils = 0.8.1
    Products.ZCTextIndex = 2.13.4

4\. Run buildout-nix

    $ buildout-nix

You should now be able to start an instance as normal:

    ./bin/instance fg

NOTE: buildout-nix is a patched version of buildout 2.2.0, which
symlinks to required eggs in the nix store instead of copying them to
./eggs. Eggs which aren't found in the environment will be downloaded
and installed to ./eggs as you would expect. If you wish to debug an egg
in the store e.g. by adding a pdb statement, you can simply replace the
symlink with a copy of the egg and change the permissions so that it is
writable.
