Using buildEnv to create a profile for Plone development
--------------------------------------------------------

The following expression allows all plone42Packages available:

/root/.nixpkgs/config.nix

\<syntaxhighlight\> {

     packageOverrides = pkgs: {
       envPythonPlonedev = pkgs.buildEnv {
         name = "env-python-plonedev-1.0";
         ignoreCollisions = true;
         paths = with pkgs; (
           lib.filter (v: (v.type or null) == "derivation")
                      (lib.attrValues plone42Packages)
         );
       };
     };

} \</syntaxhighlight\>

 These can be then be installed into a profile:

` `

1.  nix-env -iA pkgs.envPythonPlonedev -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/plone

To make use of this profile you can create an activation script which
sets some environment variables:

` /home/me/dev/plone/$ cat activate PROFILE=plone NIXPROFILE=/nix/var/nix/profiles/$PROFILE`

export PATH=$NIXPROFILE/bin:$PATH export
PYTHONPATH=$NIXPROFILE/lib/python2.7/site-packages export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$NIXPROFILE/lib"
export NIX\_LDFLAGS="-L
$NIXPROFILE/lib" export NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE="-I $NIXPROFILE/include"
export PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH="\$NIXPROFILE/lib/pkgconfig"

PS1='\\[\\033[0;36m\\][$PROFILE]'$PS1

source this file to set the variables in your current shell:

` /home/me/dev/plone $ . activate`

You should now have all you need to run buildout. A patched version of
buildout is included in the profile. This allows buildout to recognize
and use packages from the nix profile.

You need to pin some versions in your buildout.cfg to keep it happy, and
you also need to install a helper script to set the environment for
starting a zope instance so that it includes all eggs, development
packages and the nix profile packages in the path.

Here is an example: nix.cfg
` [buildout] extends = buildout.cfg parts += `

       zopenix

[instance] eggs +=

        plone.recipe.zope2instance
        Pillow

[zopenix] recipe = zc.recipe.egg eggs = \${instance:eggs} interpreter =
instance-py

[versions] docutils = 0.9.1 lxml = 3.0.2 pytz = 2012c zc.buildout =
1.7.0

This has been tested with the plone.api buildout:

`  $ git clone https://github.com/plone/plone.api.git . $ cp ../nix.cfg ./ # the file mentioned above $ buildout -c nix.cfg`

This will install a few extra eggs into ./eggs and can be used for
development. You can run ./bin/test to run the plone.api tests etc. The
normal ./bin/instance script does not like this environment, but you can
start it in debug mode like so (equivalent to \`./bin/instance fg\`):

`` $ ./bin/instance-py `which .runzope-wrapped` -C parts/instance/etc/zope.conf  -X debug-mode=on ``
