how to install software
-----------------------

there are multiple possibilities, as there is:

### system environment installation

-   software which is installed in the core system:

-   Note: it is important to NOT install using nix-env this time because
    of the kernel modules!
-   just add this line to the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

<!-- -->

     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       zsh wget
     ];

-   afterwards do:

<!-- -->

     nixos-rebuild switch

### normal user installation

-   software which is installed per user:

<!-- -->

    nix-env -i links2

how to remove installed software
--------------------------------

also depending on where the software was installed:

### system environment installation

remove the entry in environment.systemPackages = [ ];

    nixos-rebuild switch
    nix-env --delete-generations old # After this it is not possible to is the --rollback switch to reverse the uninstall.
    nix-collect-garbage

### normal user installation

    nix-env -e links2 # removes the installation form the per-user account but leaves it in the store.
    nix-env --delete-generations old # After this it is not possible to is the --rollback switch to reverse the uninstall.
    nix-collect-garbage # Now that links to the installations form the current and former generations have been deleted the garbage collector can delete them from the store.

additionally it makes sense to run:

    nix-collect-garbage -d (as root)

how to list installed software
------------------------------

### software per user

that works for each 'shell' of a single user:

     nix-env -q '*'

### software in the environment.systemPackages

there is no command to list that at this time (8jun2011)

but there is this workaround (tnx to niksnut!):

     nix-store -q --references /var/run/current-system/sw

how to update installed software
--------------------------------

### software per user

     nix-env -u '*'

### software in the environment.systemPackages

     nixos-rebuild switch

how to roll back software
-------------------------

     nix-env --rollback

Also see nix-env --list-generations.

nix-channels
------------

Since a few weeks (05/17/12 time of adding this to the wiki) there is a
NixOS channel, which is now the default mechanism for keeping NixOS up
to date. (A channel is a Nix mechanism for distributing a consistent set
of Nix expressions and binaries.)

A quick summary on how to use it:

     $ nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/releases/nixos/channels/nixos-unstable
     $ nix-channel --update
     $ nixos-rebuild switch

The NixOS channel contains a copy of Nixpkgs (but only the binaries for
i686-linux and x86\_64-linux), so after "nix-channel --update" you can
install packages via nix-env:

     $ nix-env -i thunderbird

or, if you prefer the "-A" option:

     $ nix-env -iA nixos.pkgs.thunderbird

The advantages of using a channel over the previous way (doing "svn up
/etc/nixos/\*" a.k.a. nixos-checkout) are:

-   Correctness: The channel is only updated to a new revision of
    NixOS/Nixpkgs if it passes certain tests - specifically, if all jobs
    in the "nixos:tested" view succeed
    (<http://hydra.nixos.org/view/nixos/tested>). So you have a
    reasonable certainty that the new version will actually work. By
    contrast, if you update to the latest revision using nixos-checkout,
    it's quite possible that somebody just committed something that
    broke the entire system.

-   Efficiency: The channel is only updated after all Hydra builds in
    that revision have finished, \*and\* all binaries have been
    mirrored. (Binary patches are generated asynchronously, however,
    since they can take much longer to produce.) So you don't have to
    worry about somebody just having committed something that causes a
    huge recompilation.

This makes keeping NixOS up to date a rather more pleasant activity,
IMHO (Eelco Dolstra).

Some things to note:

-   The downloaded channel sources are stored in
    /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos (which is
    actually in the Nix store). The
    $NIX_PATH environment variable contains this directory, so <nixos> and <nixpkgs> in Nix expressions resolve there unless overridden through $NIX\_PATH
    or the "-I" flag.

-   In principle, you can do rollbacks on the channels profile ("nix-env
    -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels --rollback") if you
    don't like the result of a "nix-channel --update". However, this
    doesn't roll back the corresponding binaries manifest in
    /nix/var/nix/manifest so its utility is limited [1].

-   The NixOS installation CD no longer contains or installs
    /etc/nixos/{nixos,nixpkgs} but instead uses the NixOS channel. You
    can of course run "nixos-checkout" if you want a working tree for
    development. (In other news, "nixos-checkout" now accepts a argument
    to specify the desired location of the working trees, e.g.
    "nixos-checkout /home/eelco/Dev". The default location /etc/nixos
    may eventually go away since it's a weird location for keeping large
    source trees.)

-   To use a development tree in nixos-rebuild, just use the -I flag,
    e.g. "nixos-rebuild switch -I /home/eelco/Dev".

-   The "nixpkgs\_sys" link in \~/.nix-defexpr is no longer created.
    Instead you can use "nixos.pkgs" in "nix-env -iA" calls, as shown
    above. "nixos.pkgs" is the Nixpkgs in the NixOS channel, so it's
    guaranteed to have binaries available.

-   The command "nixos-version" prints out the NixOS version you're
    currently running, e.g. "0.1pre34067-34075". The version string
    include the NixOS and Nixpkgs revisions, respectively. If you
    install from SVN it just prints "0.1pre-svn".

-   Old versions can be installed from
    <http://nixos.org/releases/nixos/>. These are periodically deleted
    because they take up a lot of space. (Note that the nixos-unstable
    channel is really just a link to the latest NixOS release.)

[1] In the future we may get rid of manifests, in which case the Right
Thing would happen magically.

nix-channels vs nixos-checkout
------------------------------

using nix-channels and nixos-checkout in parallel can lead to duplicated
entries using nix-\* tools.

how to change the used kernel version
-------------------------------------

boot.kernelPackages \# see
<http://hydra.nixos.org/build/1106908/download/1/nixos/manual.html>

for example: add

     boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_2_6_25;

to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

or check for more recent entries by:

     nix-env -qa '*' | grep linux-2.6.

how to use a different version of a package
-------------------------------------------

### kde

1\. look into pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix (when you have checked out
nixpkgs using git) and try to find something like this:

     kde4 = recurseIntoAttrs pkgs.kde47;
     kde47 = kdePackagesFor pkgs.kde47 "4.7";
     kde48 = kdePackagesFor pkgs.kde48 "4.8";

2\. now pick one of the versions by adding the lines below to
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

     nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs : rec { 
       kde4 = pkgs.kde48; 
     };

3\. finally do:

     nixos-rebuild switch

### grub

1\. similar to the kde example search the all-packages.nix for available
grub versions

2\. to use a different version of grub add this line to
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

     nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs : rec { grub2 = pkgs.grub198; };
