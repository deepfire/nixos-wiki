how to install software
-----------------------

there are multiple possibilities, as there is:

### system environment installation

-   software which is installed in the core system:

-   Note: it is important to NOT install using nix-env this time because
    of the kernel modules!
-   just add this line to the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

<!-- -->

     environment.systemPackages = [ config.boot.kernelPackages.virtualbox ];

-   afterwards do: nixos-rebuild switch

### normal user installation

-   software which is installed per user:

<!-- -->

    nix-env -i links2

how to remove installed software
--------------------------------

also depending on where the software was installed:

### system environment installation

remove the entry in environment.systemPackages = [ ];

    nixos-rebuild switch
    nix-env --delete-generations old
    nix-collect-garbage

### normal user installation

    nix-env -e links2
    nix-env --delete-generations old
    nix-collect-garbage
