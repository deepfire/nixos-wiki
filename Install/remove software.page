how to install software
-----------------------

there are multiple possibilities, as there is:

### system environment installation

-   software which is installed in the core system:

-   Note: it is important to NOT install using nix-env this time because
    of the kernel modules!
-   just add this line to the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

<!-- -->

     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       zsh wget
     ];

-   afterwards do:

<!-- -->

     nixos-rebuild switch

### normal user installation

-   software which is installed per user:

<!-- -->

    nix-env -i links2

how to remove installed software
--------------------------------

also depending on where the software was installed:

### system environment installation

remove the entry in environment.systemPackages = [ ];

    nixos-rebuild switch
    nix-env --delete-generations old # After this it is not possible to is the --rollback switch to reverse the uninstall.
    nix-collect-garbage

### normal user installation

    nix-env -e links2 # removes the installation form the per-user account but leaves it in the store.
    nix-env --delete-generations old # After this it is not possible to use the --rollback switch to reverse the uninstall.
    nix-collect-garbage # Now that links to the installations form the current and former generations have been deleted the garbage collector can delete them from the store.

additionally it makes sense to run:

    nix-collect-garbage -d (as root)

how to list installed software
------------------------------

### software per user

that works for each 'shell' of a single user:

     nix-env -q '*'

### software in the environment.systemPackages

there is no command to list that at this time (8jun2011)

but there is this workaround (tnx to niksnut!):

     nix-store -q --references /var/run/current-system/sw

how to update installed software
--------------------------------

### software per user

     nix-env -u '*'

If you want to update even SW that haven't changed version but something
did change (deps. etc.), you need to add --leq.

### software in the environment.systemPackages

If you have updated your channel with

     nix-channel --update

or updated them manually, by hand, or pulling updates from a source
control system then you can use:

     nixos-rebuild switch

to update any installed packages with updated nix expressions.

Or you can use :

     nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade

how to roll back software
-------------------------

To undo the last

     nixos-rebuild switch

you can

     nixos-rebuild --rollback

Note this does not revert configuration files like
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix to their previous states so if you do not
change them by hand the nest nixos-rebuild --switch will install them
again.

To see the available system generations you can pass the profile to
nix-env:

     nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --list-generations

To rollback the system to an earlier generation:

     nix-env --switch-generation 3141 -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
     /nix/var/nix/profiles/system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch

For per-user packages.

     nix-env --rollback

Also see nix-env --list-generations, which will list out the number of
previous generations and the time stamp of their creation.

manage nix-build/nix-shell
--------------------------

in /nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto there are links like these:

       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     74 Jul  3  2013 182qrbs2zqkm6g4waqw4xl7pc484zyss -> /home/joachim/Desktop/projects/nixos/nixpkgs/pkgs/desktops/kde-4.10/result/
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     12 Feb  1 18:23 7h9kz6xpi43rhva1alqny0hi54w6203b -> /root/result
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     45 Jul 31  2013 9355idpn9cxg4xfxgwwjvrdlg481gr0s -> /home/joachim/Desktop/projects/nix-ray/result/
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     47 Mar 20 00:15 964c6j34pd3b6qm418gc4j2pmwj890l7 -> /home/joachim/Desktop/projects/nixos/nix/result/
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     51 Mar 20 00:50 bwj2bawqgg8v2hw41h7zyidky2wsynar -> /home/joachim/Desktop/projects/nixos/nixpkgs/result/
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     32 May 12 16:19 mh0rdyn6ldcdljjzwpfzgfhmwyl7hi51 -> /tmp/nix-build.Jyenoc/derivation
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     30 Aug 20  2013 q1s5wwxrnn6dc0g856vxz22lfad4gg6h -> /home/joachim/Downloads/result/

you can remove all, which you do not need anymore BUT except this one:

       lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     43 Jun 12  2012 77pq4kkwkcsbxczg1d3hhvi4n33la519 -> /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/root/channels/

afterwards run:

       nix-store --gc

repair your installation
------------------------

Fix corrupted or missing store paths by redownloading or rebuilding
them. Note that this is slow because it requires computing a
cryptographic hash of the contents of every path in the closure of the
build.

     $ export NIX_REMOTE="" 
     $ nix-store --verify --check-contents --repair 

Note: both commands need to be run as root

nix-channels
------------

NixOS channels are now the default mechanism for keeping NixOS up to
date. (A channel is a Nix mechanism for distributing a consistent set of
Nix expressions and binaries.)

A quick summary on how to use it ([official
docs](http://nixos.org/nixos/manual/#sec-upgrading)):

     $ nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/name nixos
     $ nix-channel --update
     $ nixos-rebuild switch

Currently there are nixos and nixpkgs unstable channels, and
release-13.10 channel which only receives security+maintenance updates.

The NixOS channel contains a copy of Nixpkgs, so after "nix-channel
--update" you can install packages via nix-env:

     $ nix-env -i thunderbird

or, if you prefer the "-A" option:

     $ nix-env -iA nixos.pkgs.thunderbird

The advantages of using a channel over the previous way (doing "svn up
/etc/nixos/\*" a.k.a. nixos-checkout) are:

-   Correctness: The channel is only updated to a new revision of
    NixOS/Nixpkgs if it passes certain tests - specifically, if all jobs
    in the "nixos:tested" view succeed
    (<http://hydra.nixos.org/view/nixos/tested>). So you have a
    reasonable certainty that the new version will actually work. By
    contrast, if you update to the latest revision using nixos-checkout,
    it's quite possible that somebody just committed something that
    broke the entire system.

-   Efficiency: The channel is only updated after all Hydra builds in
    that revision have finished, \*and\* all binaries have been
    mirrored. So you don't have to worry about somebody just having
    committed something that causes a huge recompilation.

This makes keeping NixOS up to date a rather more pleasant activity,
IMHO (Eelco Dolstra).

Some things to note:

-   The downloaded channel sources are linked from
    /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos (which is
    actually in the Nix store). The
    $NIX_PATH environment variable contains this directory, so <nixos> and <nixpkgs> in Nix expressions resolve there unless overridden through $NIX\_PATH
    or the "-I" flag.

-   In principle, you can do rollbacks on the channels profile ("nix-env
    -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels --rollback") if you
    don't like the result of a "nix-channel --update".

-   The NixOS installation CD no longer contains or installs
    /etc/nixos/{nixos,nixpkgs} but instead uses the NixOS channel. You
    can of course run "nixos-checkout" if you want a working tree for
    development. (In other news, "nixos-checkout" now accepts a argument
    to specify the desired location of the working trees, e.g.
    "nixos-checkout /home/eelco/Dev". The default location /etc/nixos
    may eventually go away since it's a weird location for keeping large
    source trees.)

-   To use a development tree in nixos-rebuild, just use the -I flag,
    e.g. "nixos-rebuild switch -I /home/eelco/Dev".

-   The "nixpkgs\_sys" link in \~/.nix-defexpr is no longer created.
    Instead you can use "nixos.pkgs" in "nix-env -iA" calls, as shown
    above. "nixos.pkgs" is the Nixpkgs in the NixOS channel, so it's
    guaranteed to have binaries available.

-   The command "nixos-version" prints out the NixOS version you're
    currently running, e.g. "14.02pre-1dd0e05 (Baboon)". The version
    string include the NixOS and Nixpkgs revisions, respectively.

nix-channels vs nixos-checkout
------------------------------

using nix-channels and nixos-checkout in parallel can lead to duplicated
entries using nix-\* tools.

how to change the used kernel version
-------------------------------------

boot.kernelPackages \# see
<http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk/manual/latest/download>

for example: add

     boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_2_6_25;

to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

or check for more recent entries by:

     nix-env -qa '*' | grep linux-2.6.

how to use a different version of a package
-------------------------------------------

### kde

1\. look into pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix (when you have checked out
nixpkgs using git) and try to find something like this:

     kde4 = recurseIntoAttrs pkgs.kde47;
     kde47 = kdePackagesFor pkgs.kde47 "4.7";
     kde410 = kdePackagesFor pkgs.kde410 "4.10";

2\. now pick one of the versions by adding the lines below to
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

     nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs : rec { 
       kde4 = pkgs.kde410; 
     };

3\. install all kde stuff into the envinronment.systemPackages

     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       zsh
       linuxPackages.virtualbox
       wget
       kde4.kdemultimedia
       kde4.kdegraphics
       kde4.kdeutils
       kde4.applications
       kde4.kdegames
       kde4.kdeedu
       kde4.kdebindings
       kde4.kdeaccessibility
       #kde4.kde_baseapps
       kde4.kactivities
       kde4.kdeadmin
       kde4.kdeartwork
       #kde4.kde_base_artwork
       kde4.kdenetwork
       kde4.kdepim
       kde4.kdepimlibs
       kde4.kdeplasma_addons
       kde4.kdesdk
       kde4.kdetoys
       #kde4.kde_wallpapers
       kde4.kdewebdev
       #kde4.oxygen_icons
       kde4.kdebase_workspace
       kde4.kdelibs
       kde4.kdevelop
       kde4.kdevplatform
     ];

 4. finally do:

     nixos-rebuild switch

### grub

1\. similar to the kde example search the all-packages.nix for available
grub versions

2\. to use a different version of grub add this line to
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

     nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs : rec { grub2 = pkgs.grub198; };
