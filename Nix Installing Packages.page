What is a Nix expression?
-------------------------

A Nix expression has all information required to build a piece of
software. Generally, this means a link to the software's source code, a
list of other software required to build and/or run it, and a scripts of
shell commands required to compile its source code and install its
binaries.

When a Nix expression is evaluated, Nix will use the software's SHA hash
to find its pre-compiled binaries by searching for it in all binary
caches registered with the Nix installation. If it isn't found, Nix will
create the software's binaries by building them from source code, then
installing them into the appropriate directory structure. Once complete,
Nix will copy this resulting structure into the read-only Nix Store,
which ensures it can be used as a reliable dependency for other software
packages. This entry in the Nix Store created by a Nix expression is
called a "derivation". Finally, Nix will add a link to this derivation
to our environment, which makes it visible on the command line for us to
use.

Where can I get Nix expressions?
--------------------------------

Writing a Nix expression can be quite a challenge. Luckily, many other
people have shared their expressions by adding them to a central list,
named NixPkgs, available on the [NixPkgs GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/). If you installed Nix,
you can register the NixPkgs repository by using the `nix-channel`
command.

How to install a software package using Nix?
--------------------------------------------

The easiest way to get Nix expressions is to use the community's NixPkgs
repository. After setting it up, use the `nix-env` command to evaluate
the Nix expressions it contains.

       $ nix-channel --add http://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
       $ nix-channel --update
       $ nix-env --install hello

The [`nix-channel`](http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-channel)
command registers URL which has a Nix expression. Then, we use
`nix-channel --update` to download this Nix expression. Finally, we use
the `nix-env --install` command to install the "hello" package. The
[`nix-env`](http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-env) command installs
or removes software in our environment.

Besides the "hello" package, what else can we install? For more options,
see the other attributes in the
[`all-packages.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L8107)
file. Most of these attributes, those which are defined by the
`callPackage` or `mkDerivation` functions, creates a "Nix package".
These functions produce a package by being passed a "Nix expression"
which defines the package. These Nix expressions are stored elsewhere in
the `pkgs` directory to keep the package list easy to read.

Let's install some other packages we found in the `all-packages.nix`
file.

       $ nix-env --install firefox
       $ nix-env --install dropbox bitcoin
       $ nix-env -i dropbox bitcoin

Rather than looking at the `all-packages.nix` file to find packages, we
can also use the `nix-env --query --available` command on the command
line.

       $ nix-env --query --available firefox
       $ nix-env --query --available
       $ nix-env --query --available | grep firefox
       $ nix-env -q -a | grep firefox
       $ nix-env -qa | grep firefox

We can also see which packages we currently have installed by using the
`nix-env --query --installed` command.

       $ nix-env --query --installed
       $ nix-env -q

And of course, we can uninstall packages by using the
`nix-env --uninstall` command.

       $ nix-env --uninstall firefox
       $ nix-env -e firefox
