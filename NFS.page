Server
------

The setup is very similar as it would be done in regular config file. I
will use my setup as an example.

I wish to share 4 mount-points (/mnt/kotomi, /mnt/mafuyu, /mnt/sen,
/mnt/tomoyo) with my other computers which will run NFS clients.

First I created a separate directory for NFS shares:

    mkdir /export

Then I mount (bind) the locations inside of /export from my config.
Normally one would put it in /etc/fstab but nix generates that for us:

      fileSystems."/export/mafuyu" = { 
        device = "/mnt/mafuyu";
        options = "bind";
      };

      fileSystems."/export/sen" = { 
        device = "/mnt/sen";
        options = "bind";
      };

      fileSystems."/export/tomoyo" = { 
        device = "/mnt/tomoyo";
        options = "bind";
      };

      fileSystems."/export/kotomi" = { 
        device = "/mnt/kotomi";
        options = "bind";
      };

Next we have to tell nix how we want to export these and to whom:

    services.nfs.server.enable = true;
    services.nfs.server.exports = ''
      /export                 192.168.1.10(rw,fsid=0,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.15(rw,fsid=0,no_subtree_check)
      /export/kotomi          192.168.1.10(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.15(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
      /export/mafuyu          192.168.1.10(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.15(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
      /export/sen             192.168.1.10(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.15(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
      /export/tomoyo          192.168.1.10(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check) 192.168.1.15(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check)
    '';

Here I export all my bound shares to 2 local IPs. For various flags, you
can check the [Gentoo wiki NFSv4
article](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NFSv4#Server) which has a nice
coverage.

Remember that you can always use

    nixos-option

to check what's available.

    [shana@lenalee:~]$ nixos-option services.nfs.server
    This attribute set contains:
    createMountPoints
    enable
    exports
    hostName
    nproc

Please remember that NixOS by default has a firewall turned on! Add
rules to allow NFS traffic or switch it off if you don't need it.
