(viric) I think Side-by-side components are the way to go, so DLL are
not taken as \*strictly shared\* by Windows only based on the filename.
[This document section
3.3](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995843.aspx) says that
this behaviour of sxs will only happen if the files are placed in the
named directory, or otherwise they will be taken as shared.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i've been experimenting with nix on windows and mingw as a new
toolchain:

    https://invalidmagic.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/bringing-nix-to-its-limits/

two problems (discussed at the blog posting from above):

-   curl vs curl.exe seems to create problems (as cygwin sees both as
    the same program)
-   symlinks and dll files (PATH, missing LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH) is another

just don't forget to check it out!
