but needs lots of clean-up. Please add clarification and organization if
you can.

When deploying an instance, NixOps needs to build the environment before
transferring it to target host. This requires an existing NixOS instance
on which to build. If you use a NixOS machine for development, the same
machine is normally used for this purpose. If you use a different
machine, you must setup a Linux OS somewhere else, then configure NixOps
to use it when deploying. One way to accomplish this is by creating a
NixOS instance in a VM. Eventually, NixOps may do this for you, but for
now we must do this manually. Installing NixOS on VirtualBox is pretty
simple, so it is the recommended solution in this case. After having a
NixOS instance ready, we must set up remote access for NixOps to use
when using the machine for deployments. Here is a guide for setting up
this remote access.

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOps:Deploying_From_Non-Linux_OS&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: NixOps: Deploying from a Non-Linux OS")] NixOps: Deploying from a Non-Linux OS

-   Install a NixOS on VirtualBox. The [Installing NixOS in a VirtualBox
    guess](//Installing NixOS in a VirtualBox guest) wiki page is a good
    resource. This doesn't need any special settings, just SSH.

-   Setup a port forward so you can SSH into the machine. I'll assume
    this port forward is 3223.

-   Make a user called 'nix' on the VM. This is the user that we will
    SSH through for building. The name of the user doesn't matter, but
    these directions will assume its name is 'nix'. On your development
    machine, create two pairs of passwordless SSH keys. One pair will be
    the login for the 'nix' user. The other will be signing keys.
    Install the login public key on the VM.

-   On your development machine, run this command: \`mkdir /etc/nix/\`,
    then copy the private signing key to \`/etc/nix/signing-key.sec\`.
    Make sure this is owned by the user you'll be running nixops as and
    is readable only by that user.

-   Create a public signing key from your private signing key using
    openssl. This needs to be in whatever format openssl produces which
    is not the same as what ssh-keygen created. This output should be in
    \`/etc/nix/signing-key.pub\`. The owner and permissions don't matter
    as long as the user you'll run nixops as can read it.

<!-- -->

     openssl rsa -in /etc/nix/signing-key.sec -pubout > /etc/nix/signing-key.pub

-   Copy the signing keys to the build server, putting them in the same
    location. Make sure the nix user owns the private key and is the
    only one that can read it.

-   Tell nix to do distributed builds:

<!-- -->

     export NIX_BUILD_HOOK=$HOME/.nix-profile/libexec/nix/build-remote.pl

-   Tell the distributed builder where to store load content:

<!-- -->

     export NIX_CURRENT_LOAD=/tmp/current-load
     mkdir /tmp/current-load

-   Go into a directory you can create files in:

<!-- -->

     cat <<EOF > remote-systems.conf
     nix@nix-build-server x86_64-linux /Users/`whoami`/.ssh/id_rsa 1 1
     EOF

-   Tell the remote builder where to find machine information:

<!-- -->

     export NIX_REMOTE_SYSTEMS=$PWD/remote-systems.conf

-   Add an entry to \`\~/.ssh/config\` the fake host 'nix-build-server'
    turns into your actual VM:

<!-- -->

     Host nix-build-server
     HostName localhost
     Port 3223
