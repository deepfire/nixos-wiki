What is a Development Environment?
----------------------------------

Many software developers use an IDE to edit source code, such as
[KDevelop IDE](http://www.kdevelop.org) or
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org).

In this article, we will discuss how to use tools such as these to
develop an application. An application is built with a standard
compiler, CMake, and QT. To get started working on an application, we
need have the ability to build it, which means we need to install its
tools into our environment. When we say "install a tool into an
environment", what does this mean? In this case, it means the tools must
be easily accessible from a terminal. To clarify, when a tool, such as
Make, is **not** installed in our environment and we type `make` in a
shell, an error will be displayed, telling us that "make" does not
exist.

How can we use Nix to obtain an environment which contains all tools
required to work on a project? Well, a Nix-packaged app has a list of
tools required to *build* the app, so we can use its Nix expression to
install them. If we need more tools, such as an editor or IDE, we can
create a Nix expression which defines tools we want, then install them
in a custom environment.

### Obtaining an Environment from an App's Nix Package

A Nix package declares everything required to build the packaged code.
Therefore, if we want to work on the packaged app, we can ask the
package manager to set up the tools for us. Normally, when Nix builds a
package, it builds it in an isolated environment. It does this by
creating a child shell, clearing it to a blank slate, then adding only
the dependencies the package declares. After setting up the
dependencies, it runs the build script, moves the built app into the Nix
store, and sets up the environment to point to it. Finally, it destroys
this child shell.

We want to iteratively modify and build the packaged app. Can we ask Nix
to *not'* destroy the child shell, and instead let us use it for working
on the app? Yes we can. A Nix command was created for exactly this
use-case - the `nix-shell` command. For example, to work on the `nvi`
Nix-packaged app, use the following command to set up all build tools in
a child shell.

     nix-shell [--command /bin/sh] nvi

#### Example 1: Using nix-shell to Initialize a Development Shell

This example shows a Nix expression which packages an application that
uses the Clang compiler.

       # clang.nix
       
       let
         pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
         stdenv = pkgs.stdenv;
       in rec {
         clangEnv = stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
           name = "clang-env";
           version = "1.1.1.1";
           src = ./.;
           buildInputs = [ pkgs.clang ];
         };
       }

This `clang-env` package can be used with `nix-shell` by using the
following command.

       $ nix-shell clang.nix -A clangEnv

#### Example 3: Using myEnvFun to Create a Persistent Development Environment

The main difference between `myEnvFun` and `nix-shell` is the separation
between building a development environment and activating it. If we use
`myEnvFun`, we can individually perform these two steps. This allows us
to control when that environment gets updated. Also, if we use a Nix
user profile, we can roll back to an earlier environment.

To illustrate, suppose we have defined a development environment which
contains Clang, as defined by the following Nix expression.

       # clangenv.nix
       
       let
          pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
          stdenv = pkgs.stdenv;
       in rec {
           clangEnv = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "clang-env";
             buildInputs = with pkgs; [ clang ];
           };
       }

We can build this environment and activate it in two separate steps.

       # Build the environment.
       $ nix-build -A clangEnv clangenv.nix
       
       # Activate the environment.
       $ ./result/bin/load-env-clang

To lock this development environment, we can use a user profile. The
following commands install our Clang environment into the `clang` user
profile and makes a convenience link to that profile's Clang environment
into the current directory.

       $ nix-env -iA clangEnv -f envfun.nix -p /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/clang
       
       # Make a convenience link.
       $ ln -sf /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/clang/bin/load-env-clang .
       
       # Activate the environment.
       $ ./load-env-clang
       
       # Optionally, rollback to an earlier generation of this profile.
       $ nix-env --list-generations -p /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/clang

### Obtaining an Environment from a Custom Definition

The first solution, to rely on the Nix package, will give us a single
shell which can build the app, which is a very useful tool. Sometimes,
however, we want to use the entire OS as a development environment,
rather than a single shell. This implies that every new shell, as well
as every application we launch from the desktop, will be able to build
the app. How can we do this?

If we answer this question in the context of NixOS, we are asking about
the "User Environment", which is a set of "active" applications.
Remember, a user can install many applications using Nix, but they are
all hidden in the Nix store behind hash-named directories. To use these
applications, they must be made visible to a shell by adding these
applications to the `PATH` environment variable. The implementation is
rather complicated, but the key idea is that Nix manages which of its
applications are visible. This set of applications is called a "User
Environment".

#### Introducing myEnvFun

So, our goal is to create a User Environment which contains all required
tools to edit a Nix-packaged app. How do we create this User
Environment? An app was created which helps us define a custom User
Environment and then switch to it. This package is called `myEnvFun`.

How do we use `myEnvFun`? Currently, it requires a bit of setup. If you
want to read existing documentation, you have to read the [`myEnvFun`
source
code](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/misc/my-env/default.nix).
I'm trying to better document this tool with this Wiki page.

So, how do we use this tool? The idea is that we write a Nix expression
which defines a development environment, more precisely, **the tools**
we want in our development environment. Nix manages dependencies and
ensures they are built. Can we say that code editing tools are
dependencies of a development environment? Sure!

So, the idea is that we create a Nix expression which accepts a name and
a set of Nix packages. The name will be the name of the development
environment, and the set of Nix packages will be the set of tools we
need to work on the application.

First, place the Nix expression which defines our development
environment in `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix`. Using the following code as a
template, we can create an environment, name it, and add tools to it.

     {
       packageOverrides = pkgs : with pkgs; {
         sdlEnv = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "someEnvName";
             buildInputs = [ stdenv pkgconfig toolOne toolTwo toolThree ];
         };
       };
     }

With this development environment defined, we install the package which
contains it with the following command. Note that the package which
contains our environment uses a `env-<envName>` naming convention.

     $ nix-env -i env-someEnvName

To switch to this environment, we use the following command. Note the
naming convention.

     $ load-env-someEnvName

#### Using myEnvFun Environments

To test the results, try to use one of this environment's tools from
this shell.

Other shells won't have this environment, so we must use the
`load-env-someEnvName` command again to switch to the environment before
using its tools.

#### Example: "SDL" Environment

The author of [this blog
post](http://invalidmagic.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/developing-software-using-nixos/)
shows how to use the `myEnvFun` tool to create an environment to use
SDL. He creates an SDL environment for it with the following Nix
expression.

     {
       packageOverrides = pkgs : with pkgs; {
         sdlEnv = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "sdl";
             buildInputs = [ stdenv SDL SDL_image SDL_ttf SDL_gfx cmake SDL_net pkgconfig ];
         };
       };
     }

Then, we can use the SDL environment as follows.

First, load the SDL environment.

     [~/Desktop/projects]$ load-env-sdl
     env-sdl loaded

Then we can use commands which exist only in this SDL environment,
because they exist in Nix packages declared in the environment
definition. For example, we can use the `sdl-config` command to get
cflags.

     sdl:[~/Desktop/projects]$ sdl-config --cflags
     -I/nix/store/652x8hnhja32z3ja4hip04ygn8mh9cwi-SDL-1.2.14/include/SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT

And we can use `sdl-config` command to get library position.

     sdl:[~/Desktop/projects]$ sdl-config --libs
     -L/nix/store/652x8hnhja32z3ja4hip04ygn8mh9cwi-SDL-1.2.14/lib -Wl,-rpath,/nix/store/652x8hnhja32z3ja4hip04ygn8mh9cwi-SDL-1.2.14/lib -lSDL -lpthread

In the `Makefile` of a project which uses SDL, we usually use
`sdl-config` to get these values and paths. In an SDL environment, we
can also use these commands.

##### Using Libraries not using `pkgconfig`

When you load `load-env-sdl` there will be some additional environment
variables set:

-   CMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH
-   NIX\_CFLAGS\_COMPILE
-   NIX\_LDFLAGS

All these variables contain include paths and ldflags used by the
compiler.

Note: `load-env-sdl` and SDL is just an example. The mentioned
environment variables can be used for various libraries which don't use
`sdl-config`-like tools.

Note: Once these paths are set correctly (caused by the
`load-env-someEnvName` command) you would not depend on tools like
`sdl-config` or `pkgconfig`. This helps to get libraries working which
don't use these kind of tools to make them accessible.

##### Code Completion in KDevelop IDE

The KDevelop IDE has a code completion feature, but it will only work if
it has access to the source code of referenced libraries. This is a
problem on NixOS, because these libraries exist in the Nix store, which
is unique among Linux distributions. To make the correct libraries
visible to KDevelop when working on a project, launch it from a shell
which was created from the `myEnvFun` tool. The following commands can
give you an idea.

     rm -Rf myCustomProject/build/*
     load-env-sdl #(where the project would use cmake)

Now, start `kdevelop` from this shell, which is the development
environment for SDL. Import the `CMakeLists.txt` of the project. When
KDevelop asks where to build the project, choose the default option,
`myCustomProject/build`. After building the selection, code completion
should work for the whole project. What might not work, however, is
opening several projects in the same KDevelop session.

Sample Development Environments
-------------------------------

### Python - Plone Development Environment

       {
         # Define a myEnvFun environment, which makes use of pythonPlone
         packageOverrides = pkgs: rec {
        
           # Define a version of Python which has access to all the Plone modules
           pythonPlone = pkgs.pythonFull.override {
             extraLibs = with pkgs.python27Packages; [ Plone ];
           };
        
           plone = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "plone";
             buildInputs = with pkgs; [
               pythonPlone
               python27Packages.zc_buildout_nix
               stdenv # provides gcc for building python c extensions
            ];
            # Export the path to the custom version of Python with all the goodies
            # Other Python command line utilies could also be used, e.g. IPython
            extraCmds = 
              export PYTHONHOME=${pythonPlone}
              unset http_proxy # otherwise downloads will fail ("nodtd.invalid")
            ;
           };
        
         };
       }

Summary
-------

We can add several different environments to our `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix`
file, one for each project we work on. These can be used one at a time
to develop a variety of projects while keeping each relatively isolated.
We can exit these environments as one would exit any shell session, by
using the `CTRL+D` shortcut or the `exit` command.

What's the main benefit of using this technique? We don't pollute our
main profile with many development tools, which may have conflicts.
Also, we can use different versions of a library on the same system,
selecting them by selecting a development environment.
