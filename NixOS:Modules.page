NixOS has modules to have non-intrusive extensions. Modules are made to
avoid manipulating the core of NixOS while allowing the user to separate
their `configuration.nix` file into multiple sub-file which are specific
to a device or a service configuration. Such separation permits the
creation of services which can be tested for a while before being merged
in the main line of NixOS.

This page describes how you can create a module. If you want a pratical
view, you should have a look into this small
[tutorial](//NixOS:extend NixOS).

Vocabulary
----------

-   [Declaration](//NixOS:Declaration): All options which are used with
    the `mkOption` function are declared. Declared options should at
    least have a `description` attribute which contains a multiple-line
    text of describing the effect of the option.
-   [Definition](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Definition&action=edit&redlink=1 "NixOS:Definition (page does not exist)"):
    All options which are set to plain values are considered as
    definitions. The plain value may vary depending on the expected type
    of the option.
-   Use: All result of options which are used to compute values of other
    option are option usages.
-   [Properties](//NixOS:Properties): These are option definition
    modifiers. Properties may change the influence of an option
    definition in the computation of an option result.

To find all files which are defining or declaring an option, you may
refer to the generated NixOS manual or to the `man` page of
`configuration.nix`.

Syntax
------

Modules are declared with the following syntax:

    {
      imports = [
        # list of path to other modules.
      ];

      options = {
        # attribute set of option declarations.
      };

      config = {
        # attribute set of option definitions.
      };
    }

Another syntax exists for cases where no option declaration are
necessary:

    {
      require = [
        # list of path to other modules.
      ];

      # attribute set of option definitions.
    }

Both of the previous syntax can be refined with an attribute set
argument added on top:

    {config, pkgs, ...}:

    {
      # ...
    }

The following arguments can be retrieved from this attribute set:

-   [`config`](//NixOS:config argument): The configuration of the entire
    system.
-   `options`: All option declarations refined with all definition and
    declaration references.
-   `pkgs`: The attribute set extracted from the Nix package collection
    and enhanced with the `nixpkgs.config` option.
-   `modulesPath`: The location of the `module` directory of NixOS.

For more information, you should refer to NixOS sources, with more
insight into
[`nixos/lib/eval-config.nix`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos/blob/master/lib/eval-config.nix%7C).

More computation or organisation can be necessary to enhance modules. In
which case, you can add a `let .. in ..` statement between the argument
and the attribute set.

    {config, pkgs, ...}:

    let
      # intermediate result.
    in

    {
      # ...
    }

-   Debian [Config::Model](http://wiki.debian.org/PackageConfigUpgrade):

target configuration upgrades by abstracting the option of the
configuration. Each file is a tree structure where leaves are values
defined with an interpreted type. The interpreters are defined for each
meta-configuration files name \*.conf. Configuration files does not
seems to interact with each other to make consistent configuration. They
provide an UI for editing their configuration file.
