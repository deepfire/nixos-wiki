Frequently asked questions and common newcomer trouble should be put
here so that we can point to this page intsead of answering the same
question over and over again.

Why is Nix written in C++ and Perl rather than a functional language like Haskell or OCaml, given the strong influence that functional programming has obviously had on Nix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mainly because Nix is intended to be lightweight, easy to learn and
portable (zero dependencies).

NixOS segfaults when running on VirtualPC:
------------------------------------------

You may have hit
<http://jagbarcelo.blogspot.com/2009/11/segmentation-fault-ubuntu-virtual-pc.html>
There may be a different cause (out of memory) You can check
/var/log/messages to see if there is something about the OOM killer
kicking in

Nix(OS) substitutes break on older [Btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/Btrfs) implementation since the merge of SQLite support (feb 2011 in trunk)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subtituted files are padded by zero bytes, which makes them unusable.
Upgrading Btrfs to 2.6.37+ kernel resolves the issue.

Using nix to install new software requires to download the source from upstream and sometimes that source has moved and therefore the download won't work but after some google search with: 'myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz "index of"' one usually can find the file an download it either:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   download manually and copy into /tmp, then:

to move that file into the store one can use:

     nix-prefetch-url file:///tmp/myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz if the file is in the /tmp directory

-   download directly

<!-- -->

     nix-prefetch-url "http://myfoohost.com/programs/foo/myfile-0.1.2.tar.gz"

How to restart a systemd service?
---------------------------------

     systemctl restart unit

A list of services can be found with:

     systemctl list-units

How to keep build-time dependencies around / be able to rebuild while being offline?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

configuration.nix:

     nix.extraOptions = ''
       gc-keep-outputs = true
       gc-keep-derivations = true
     '';

Check 'man configuration.nix' for these options. Rebuild for these
options to take effect:

     # nixos-rebuild switch

List all store paths that form the system closure and realise them:

     $ nix-store -qR $(nix-instantiate /etc/nixos/nixos -A system) | xargs nix-store -r
     warning: you did not specify `--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
     ...
     <build output and list of successfully realised paths>

Repeat for your user and further profiles:

     $ nix-store -qR ~/.nix-profile |xargs nix-store -r

The warning can be ignored for profiles that are listed/linked in
/nix/var/nix/profiles/ or one of its subdirectories.

Consult man pages of nix-store and nix-instantiate for further
information.

how to add a custom udev rule in nixos?
---------------------------------------

add something like this to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file:

     services.udev.extraRules = ''
        ATTRS{idVendor}=="0665", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5161", MODE="666", SYMLINK+="hidraw_protecthome"
      '';

Why \<hash\>-\<name\> instead of \<name\>-\<hash\>?
---------------------------------------------------

For the rare cases where we have to dig into the /nix/store it is more
practical to keep in mind the first few letters at the beginning than
finding a package by name. In addition, the hash is printed by Nix
commands. I you still wonder why, run
"`ls -1 /nix/store | sort -R -t - -k 2 | less`" in your shell.

This is what might happen if you don't garbage collect frequently, or if
you are testing compilation variants:
