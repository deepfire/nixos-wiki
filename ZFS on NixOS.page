NixOS has native support for ZFS. It uses the code from the [ZFS on
Linux project](http://zfsonlinux.org/), including kernel modules and
userspace utilities.

What works
----------

All functionality supported by ZFS on Linux, including:

-   Using ZFS as the root filesystem (using either MS-DOS or GPT
    partitions)
-   Encrypted ZFS pools (using Linux's dm-crypt)
-   All the other ZFS goodies (cheap snapshotting, checksumming,
    compression, RAID-Z, ...)

Known issues
------------

-   As of 2014-03-04, you shouldn't use a ZVol as a swap device, as it
    deadlocks under memory pressure
-   As of 2014-03-04, you should set the `mountpoint` property of your
    ZFS filesystems to be `legacy` and let NixOS mount them using
    systemd, otherwise some filesystems may fail to mount due to
    ordering issues
-   As of 2014-03-04, all ZFS pools available to the system will be
    forcibly imported during boot, regardless if you had imported them
    before or not. You should be careful not to have any other system
    accessing them at the same time, otherwise it will corrupt your
    pools. Normally (for the common desktop user) this should not be a
    problem, as a hard disk is usually only connected to one machine.

How to use it
-------------

Just add the following to your `configuration.nix` file:

      boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];

And run `nixos-rebuild switch`, as usual.

All ZFS functionality should now be available.

If you want NixOS to auto-mount your ZFS filesystems during boot, you
should set their `mountpoint` property to `legacy`, mount the filesystem
manually and regenerate your list of filesystems, as such:

      zfs set mountpoint=legacy <pool>/<fs>
      mount -t zfs <pool>/<fs> <mountpoint>
      nixos-generate-config

NixOS will now make sure that your filesystem is mounted during boot.
The last command regenerates your
`/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix` file, which includes the list of
filesystems for NixOS to mount during boot, e.g.:

    (...)
      fileSystems."/home" =
        { device = "rpool/home";
          fsType = "zfs";
        };

      fileSystems."/backup" =
        { device = "rpool/backup";
          fsType = "zfs";
        };
    (...)

How to install NixOS on a ZFS root filesystem
---------------------------------------------

Here's an example of how to create a ZFS root pool using 4 disks in
RAID-10 mode (striping+mirroring), create a ZFS root+home filesystems
and install NixOS on them: (thanks to Danny Wilson for the instructions)

    # Add the zfs filesystem to the install environment:
    nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---
      boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];
    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---

    nixos-rebuild switch

    # Load the just installed ZFS kernel module
    modprobe zfs

    # Create boot partition and (zfs) data partition
    # See: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem#step-2-disk-partitioning
    fdisk /dev/sda

    # Copy the partition table to the other disks
    sfdisk --dump /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb
    sfdisk --dump /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdc
    sfdisk --dump /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdd

    # Create a RAID-10 ZFS pool. Use "-o ashift=12" to create your ZFS pool with 4K sectors
    zpool create -o ashift=12 -o altroot=/mnt rpool mirror /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 mirror /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdd2

    # Create the filesystems
    zfs create -o mountpoint=none rpool/ROOT
    zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy rpool/ROOT/nixos
    zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy rpool/HOME
    zfs set compression=lz4 rpool/HOME    # compress the home directories automatically

    # Mount the filesystems manually
    mount -t zfs rpool/ROOT/nixos /mnt

    mkdir /mnt/home
    mount -t zfs rpool/HOME /mnt/home

    # Create a raid mirror of the first partitions for /boot (GRUB)
    mdadm --build /dev/md127 --metadata=0.90 --level=1 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sd[a,b,c,d]1
    mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -L boot -j /dev/md127

    mkdir /mnt/boot
    mount /dev/md127 /mnt/boot

    # Generate the NixOS configuration, as per the NixOS manual
    nixos-generate-config --root /mnt

    # Now edit the generated hardware config:
    nano /mnt/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix

    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---
    # This is what you want:

      fileSystems."/" =
        { device = "rpool/ROOT/nixos";
          fsType = "zfs";
        };

      fileSystems."/home" =
        { device = "rpool/HOME";
          fsType = "zfs";
        };

      fileSystems."/boot" =
        { device = "/dev/md127";
          fsType = "ext4";
        };
    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---

    # configuration.nix needs an adjustment:
    nano /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---
    # This is some more of what you want:

      boot.loader.grub.devices = [ "/dev/sda" "/dev/sdb" "/dev/sdc" "/dev/sdd" ];
      boot.supportedFilesystems = [ "zfs" ];
    ## ---8<-------------------------8<---

    # Ready to go!
    nixos-install
