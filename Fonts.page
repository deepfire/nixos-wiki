### Installation

1.  Pick a few fonts (`nix-env -qaP|grep -i font` or look at
    <https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/data/fonts> )
2.  Put them in `configuration.nix`:

<!-- -->

     {
       fonts = {
         enableFontDir = true;
         enableGhostscriptFonts = true;
         fonts = with pkgs; [
           corefonts  # Micrsoft free fonts
           inconsolata  # monospaced
           ubuntu_font_family  # Ubuntu fonts
         ];
       };
     }

### Debugging

The global Fontconfig configuration is kept in `/etc/fonts/fonts.conf`.
This file is generated automatically, and should not be edited directly,
but it can be useful to see what is actually written there. If you
enable `enableFontDir`, all fonts are available under
`/run/current-system/sw/share/X11-fonts` as well

You can also use `xlsfonts` to see which fonts are available to X.
