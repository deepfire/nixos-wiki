Getting ALSA to work
--------------------

-   on a console fire up alsamixer

<!-- -->

     alsamixer

-   you see plenty of vertical bars?
    -   you should be okay

-   you see very few vertical bars and the sound card (top-left) is
    something like "PC Speaker"?
    -   hit the 'S' key, you should be able to switch to the "real"
        audio card (if not your audio card is likely to not being
        supported yet).
    -   when the real audio card is selected you should be viewing the
        "plenty vertical bars" thing.
        -   first thing to do is to disable pc speaker (kernel module
            "snd-pcsp", see below.

### Make your audio card the default ALSA card

Sometimes the pc-speaker because the default audio card for ALSA. You
can make your real sound card default instead. For example, if your
sound card is "hda-intel" then add

      boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
        options snd slots=snd-hda-intel
      '';

to your /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.

Alternatively you can ...

### Disable PC Speaker "audio card"

edit /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and "snd\_pcsp" to
boot.blacklistedKernelModules option:

     boot.blacklistedKernelModules = [ "snd_pcsp" ];

Now reboot and retry from the beginning (i.e. check that your real card
is shown by alsamixer without using the 'S' key).

### Fixing sound in KDE

(alsamixer shows my audio card by default, but i get no sound in KDE)

-   be sure to explicitly install pkgs.kde4.phonon in
    /etc/nixos/configuration.nix (environment.kdePackages option) or via
    nix-env -i

After this step you should be seeing xine and gstreamer backends in the
systemsettings / Computer Administration / Multimedia 's Backends tab.

-   If you still see Pulseaudio as the only option in the main tab of
    systemsettings / Computer Administration / Multimedia, do the
    following:

<!-- -->

     $ rm -rf ~/.pulse/*
     $ killall5 -9 pulseaudio

-   Log out of kde and re-login

Now you should be able to select your audio card, default hw0,0 etc as
your audio device in systemsettings / Computer Administration /
Multimedia

Test the audio and enjoy the relaxing KDE's arpeggio.
