Sometimes you want to use a faster machine for building a nix derivation
you want to use on a slower one. If both of them run NixOS you can
follow this little HOWTO to make it happen.

--- ignore this, look at nix.buildMachines in [NixOS
Manual](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/trunk/manual/latest/download)
---

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to setup public key based login from the slower machine to
root account on the one that'll do the actual building, and this article
won't cover setting this up (there are many that do, so you shouldn't
have any problem googling this).

Preparing
---------

First you have to prepare the remote-systems.conf file on the slower
machine, for example in /etc/nixos/remote-systems.conf, with contents
similar to:

    root@builder.example.com i686-linux /etc/nixos/id_rsa 4

Where:

1\. root@builder.example.com is and addres of the machine that'll do the
build. If you want to use port other than 22, you have to set up an
alias in /root/.ssh/config

2\. i686-linux is a platform of that machine

3\. /etc/nixos/id\_rsa is a path to the private part of a key used to log
in to the builder

4\. 4 is a number of jobs that should be run in parallel on that machine

As a convenience, we'll make a little script. Put this into
/etc/nixos/remote-build-env:

    mkdir /tmp/build-remote-load/
    chmod a+rwX /tmp/build-remote-load/

    # First find our build hook script
    STORE_PATH_FOR_NIX=$(ls -l `which nix-env` | awk '{ sub( /bin\/nix-env/, "", $NF ); print $NF }')
    BUILD_REMOTE=`find "${STORE_PATH_FOR_NIX}" -name build-remote.pl`

    # now set up environment for nix-worker                    
    export NIX_BUILD_HOOK="${BUILD_REMOTE}"
    export NIX_REMOTE_SYSTEMS="/etc/nixos/remote-systems.conf"
    export NIX_CURRENT_LOAD="/tmp/build-remote-load"

Running the build
-----------------

This is the part that you'll have to do every time you want to build
something remotely. First, as root:

    stop nix-daemon
    . /etc/nixos/remote-build-env
    nix-worker --daemon &

Then, as a user you want to do the build as:

    . /etc/nixos/remote-build-env

after that you can run nix-env normally, and the work should be
distributed among machines in your remote-systems.conf
