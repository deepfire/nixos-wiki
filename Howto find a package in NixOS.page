This page's intended audience is advanced Nix users. For a
newbie-friendly and more up-to-date page, see [Installing
Packages](//Nix Installing Packages)

Simple package query
--------------------

The most straight-forward way to see a list of all available packages is
to use the `nix-env` command. This method is a bit slow, as every
package must be evaluated when generating the list. (Note: In the
results, the first column is the package's attribute path.)

      nix-env -qa [-P] [--out-path] [ -f $NIXPKGS_ALL ]

Aliases
-------

The command to query available packages is relatively long, but we can
define shortcuts or aliases. To define a shell function as an alias,
Bash-shell users can add this to their `~/.bashrc` file.

    queryNixPkgs(){ nix-env -qa \* -P -f $NIXPKGS_ALL | grep -i "$1"; }

Install by attribute
--------------------

A package can be defined in a few different ways. Sometimes, a package
is implemented in a complicated way, likely to share part of its
definition with another package. In a case like this, a package may be
defined in an attribute set one level deeper than the usual package set
defined in the `top-level/all-packages.nix` file.

For example, the following Nix expression contains the `myPackage`
package, defined in a deep attribute set.

    {
      attr = { subattr = { subattr = { myPackage = mkDerivation ...; } } }
      # Or, an alternative notation:
      attr.subattr.subattr.package = mkDerivation ...;
    }

Packages which are defined in a set deeper than normal can be added to a
higher-level set by using the `recurseIntoAttrs` function. If they are
included in a higher-level set, their installation should be simple. If
not, the package can be referenced by using its full attribute path in
an expression.

For example, to install the package defined in the above Nix expression,
pass its full attribute path to the `nix-env` program and use the `-A`
flag.

    nix-env -i -A attr.subattr.subattr.package

Indexing and searching Nix files
--------------------------------

One method of quickly finding the attribute names of packages is to use
the Ctags program, which is a tool used for code navigation. To use this
method, install the
[`ctagsWrapped`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/bee4c41e13a9276db4f4a582234c670d74edfa1a/pkgs/development/tools/misc/ctags/wrapped.nix%7C)
package, then use the `ctags` command line program to index Nix files or
directories of Nix files, such as a directory which contains the NixPkgs
repository. This package customizes a ctags installation by adding a
definition for the Nix syntax. To learn more about the Ctags program,
read the [website](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/%7Cctags).

Another method of indexing Nix expressions is to use the ID Utils
program. The [HOWTO:idutils|IdUtils] wiki page has more details. To
learn more about the ID Utils program, read the [Utils
website](https://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/%7CID).
