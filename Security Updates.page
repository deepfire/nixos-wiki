When a new security update is committed to
<https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs> it might not be readily available in
the nixos channel for multiple reasons:

1.  A base library has been updated like openssl or libc, thus requiring
    a lot of packages to be rebuilt. This may take a few days in hydra
    or even by compiling everything by yourself on you server.
2.  Even if all the packages were updated, nixos tests may fail and thus
    the channel will not update. In this case you may use the hydra
    cache, but it's better to wait for tests to pass for obvious
    reasons.

To overcome this issue, NixOS provides an option for replacing runtime
dependencies of the system (note, not packages installed by nix-env)
without the need to rebuild everything.

Let's say we have to update openssl and that the update has landed in
nixpkgs. First of all we want to get openssl from nixpkgs:

    cd /some/path
    git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs

Note that in pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix openssl is called as:

      openssl = callPackage ../development/libraries/openssl {
        fetchurl = fetchurlBoot;
        cryptodevHeaders = linuxPackages.cryptodev.override {
          fetchurl = fetchurlBoot;
          onlyHeaders = true;
        };
      };

Then we may put this in configuration.nix:

      system.replaceRuntimeDependencies = with pkgs; [
        ({ original = openssl;
           replacement = callPackage /some/path/nixpkgs/pkgs/development/libraries/openssl {
             fetchurl = fetchurlBoot;
             cryptodevHeaders = linuxPackages.cryptodev.override {
               fetchurl = fetchurlBoot;
               onlyHeaders = true;
             };
           };
        })
      ];

system.replaceRuntimeDependencies expects a list of attributes {
original, replacement }. You may put several of those updates. It's
important that the replacement derivation has the same name length of
the original derivation (if it's not the case, an error will be reported
before switching to the new configuration).

Make sure you keep track of this update and to remove it once you
upgrade to a nixos version that includes the update.
