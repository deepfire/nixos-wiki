NixOS has some work-in-progress support for running [OpenStack
Compute](http://openstack.org/projects/compute/) (also known as
**Nova**), an infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing platform. It's
currently limited to running all of Nova on a single machine, so it's
mostly useful for experimentation.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS_and_OpenStack_Compute&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Enabling Nova")] Enabling Nova
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the following to your `configuration.nix`:

    virtualisation.nova.enableSingleNode = true;

and run `nixos-rebuild switch`. This will enable several daemons:

-   `nova-api` is the API server that receives and executes requests
    from cloud users, e.g. to start, query or terminate virtual
    machines.
-   `nova-objectstore` is a simple disk image server. It serves images
    placed in `/var/lib/nova/images/`.
-   `nova-scheduler` schedules VM execution requests and hands them over
    to a `nova-compute` node.
-   `nova-network` manages networks and allocates IP addresses.
-   `nova-compute` starts and manages virtual machines. It downloads
    disk images from `nova-objectstore`.
-   `libvirtd` is the low-level daemon responsible for running and
    managing virtual machines.
-   `rabbitmq` is a messaging protocol used by the various Nova
    components to communicate with each other.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS_and_OpenStack_Compute&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Configuring and testing Nova")] Configuring and testing Nova
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now create a user with administrative privileges:

    $ nova-manage user admin eelco
    2011-04-07 12:57:23,806 AUDIT nova.auth.manager [-] Created user eelco (admin: True)

You should also create a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to
VMs:

    $ nova-manage network create 10.0.0.0/8 1 32

Nova will set up `iptables` rules to perform NAT on these addresses
automatically.

You should also create a *project*. In Nova, VMs are always associated
with a project, which can have multiple users. To create a project
`test` with `eelco` as owner:

    $ nova-manage project create test eelco
    2011-04-07 13:03:01,404 AUDIT nova.auth.manager [-] Created project test with manager eelco

Tools such as `euca2ools`, which allow you to perform operations on the
cloud, require a number of environment variables containing stuff such
as credentials and the URL of the API server. To obtain the necessary
environment variables for a specific project and user:

    $ nova-manage project environment test eelco

This create a file `./novarc`, which you can source from your shell
(e.g. `source ./novarc`). The important variables are:

    export EC2_ACCESS_KEY="72389c9d-...:test"
    export EC2_SECRET_KEY="6c145c32-..."
    export EC2_URL="http://192.168.1.20:8773/services/Cloud"

Next we'll get a small VM images so that we can run a VM.

    $ cd /var/lib/nova/images
    $ curl http://images.ansolabs.com/tty.tgz | tar xvfzo -
    $ nova-manage image convert /var/lib/nova/images

Check that Nova can see the images:

    $ euca-describe-images 
    IMAGE   ami-tty demo/tty        admin   available       public          x86_64  machine aki-tty ari-tty
    IMAGE   aki-tty nova/tty-kernel admin   available       public          x86_64  kernel           
    IMAGE   ari-tty nova/tty-ramdisk        admin   available       public          x86_64  ramdisk          

To log in to VMs via SSH, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair. The
VM will receive the public key on startup, while you get the private key
to log in.

    $ euca-add-keypair my_key > my_key
    $ chmod 600 my_key

Now we can start a VM:

    $ euca-run-instances -k my_key ami-tty
    RESERVATION     r-ngnfe3x6      test    default
    INSTANCE        i-00000007      ami-tty                 scheduling      my_key (test, None)     2011-04-07 12:50:19.155448      None    None

After a while, if everything works out, the VM will start. You can get
its IP address using `euca-describe-instances`:

    $ euca-describe-instances i-00000007
    RESERVATION     r-ngnfe3x6      test    default
    INSTANCE        i-00000007      ami-tty 10.0.0.3        10.0.0.3        running         my_key (test, stan)     0       m1.small        2011-04-07 12:50:19.155448      nova

So we can now log in using the SSH key generated above:

    $ ssh -i ./my_key 10.0.0.3
    ...
    # uname -a
    Linux ttylinux_host 2.6.35-22-virtual #35-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 16 23:19:29 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS_and_OpenStack_Compute&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Running NixOS")] Running NixOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course you'll want to run NixOS VMs in your private cloud. This
requires building a NixOS disk image.

    $ NIXOS_CONFIG=/etc/nixos/nixos/modules/virtualisation/nova-config.nix \
        nix-build /etc/nixos/nixos/ -A config.system.build.novaImage

You can (sort of) test whether the VM works by running
`qemu-img create ./image -b ./result/image -f qcow2; qemu-kvm -nographic ./image`.

Now make the image available:

    $ mkdir /var/lib/nova/images/ami-nixos
    $ cp ./result/image /var/lib/nova/images/ami-nixos/

and create a file `/var/lib/nova/images/ami-nixos/info.json` with the
following contents:

    {
        "imageId": "ami-nixos",
        "imageLocation": "nixos/nixos",
        "imageOwnerId": "eelco",
        "imageState": "available",
        "type": "machine",
        "isPublic": true,
        "architecture": "x86_64"
    }

You can then start a NixOS VM as follows:

    $ euca-run-instances -k my_key ami-nixos

Once the VM is running, you should be able to log in via SSH. For
information on using the VM, see [NixOS on Amazon
EC2](//NixOS on Amazon EC2).

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS_and_OpenStack_Compute&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: To Do")] To Do
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Support running Nova components on multiple machines (especially
    `nova-compute`).
-   Use MySQL instead of SQLite.
-   Don't use RabbitMQ's guest user.
-   Don't run everything as root.
