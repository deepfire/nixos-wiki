The NixOS source tree contains tests that use automatically instantiated
virtual machines to test various features of the system. These tests
define virtual networks of virtual NixOS machines and test scripts that
use them. This approach is described in an [ISSRE-2010
paper](http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~dolstra/pubs/decvms-issre2010-final.pdf).
While it uses NixOS in the VMs, it is not limited to testing NixOS: if
you have a (distributed) application or system-level package that you
wish to test automatically, you can use the NixOS VM testing framework.
Note that NixOS is *not* required on the host system - any Linux system
(such as Ubuntu) with KVM support should work.

Running a test
--------------

If you don't have NixOS as your host OS, you should first [install the
Nix package manager](http://nixos.org/nix/download.html) and obtain the
Nixpkgs and NixOS source trees:

    $ svn co https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk nixpkgs
    $ svn co https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixos/trunk nixos

To speed up builds by using pre-built binaries, you should do:

    $ nix-pull http://nixos.org/releases/nixpkgs/channels/nixpkgs-unstable/MANIFEST

Now you can run a test as follows:

    $ nix-build nixos/tests/ -A nfs.test

This performs an automated test of the NFS client and server
functionality in the Linux kernel, including file locking semantics
(e.g., whether locks are maintained across server crashes). It will
first build or download all the dependencies of the test (e.g., all
packages needed to run a NixOS VM). The test is defined in
`nixos/tests/nfs.nix`. If the test succeeds, `nix-build` will place a
symlink `./result` in the current directory pointing at the location in
the Nix store of the test results (e.g., screenshots, test reports, and
so on).

### Interactive testing

Screenshot of running the NFS test environment interactively.

It is also possible to run the test environment interactively, allowing
you to experiment with the VMs. For example:

    $ nix-build nixos/tests/ -A nfs.driver
    $ ./result/bin/nixos-run-vms

The script `nixos-run-vms` starts the three virtual machines defined in
the NFS test using QEMU/KVM. The root filesystem of the VMs is created
on the fly and kept across VM restarts in `./hostname.qcow2`.

Finally, you can run the test itself interactively. This is particularly
useful when developing or debugging a test.

    $ nix-build nixos/tests/ -A nfs.driver
    $ ./result/bin/nixos-test-driver
    starting VDE switch for network 1
    >

You can now type Perl statements to execute commands to start or
manipulate the VMs:

    > startAll;
    (the VMs start booting)
    > $server->waitForJob("nfs-kernel-nfsd");
    > $client1->succeed("flock -x /data/lock -c 'sleep 100000' &");
    > $client2->fail("flock -n -s /data/lock true");
    > $client1->shutdown;
    (this releases client1's lock)
    > $client2->succeed("flock -n -s /data/lock true");

The function `testScript` executes the entire test script and drops you
back into the test driver command line upon its completion. This allows
you to inspect the state of the VMs after the test (e.g. to debug the
test script).
