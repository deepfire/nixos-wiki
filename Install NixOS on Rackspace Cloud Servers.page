This are just a few notes I took down while performing a NixOS
installation on a freshly created Rackspace Cloud Server running Gentoo.
This is not the ideal way to install NixOS, but it is a way to get
things done since bootstrapping NixOS from within a Linux distribution
is currently broken.

We are going need the contents of the following files, so it might be a
good idea to write them down or download those files to your local
machine.

    # cat /etc/resolve.conf | tail -n 2
    nameserver 72.3.128.240
    nameserver 72.3.128.241

    # cat /etc/conf.d/net | tail -n 9

    config_eth0="209.61.142.12 netmask 255.255.255.0"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am assuming that you are starting from a fresh Gentoo installation.
This might not be necessary. Just be aware that this procedure will
destroy all data on the server. So have backups ready in case you do
have important data on it.

First, you need to put your Cloud Server into Rescue Mode from the
Rackspace Cloud control panel. This will mount a rescue system. Your
actual system is available at /dev/xvdb1 (root) and /dev/xvdd1 (swap).

First thing we want to do is formatting our root partition and mount it
to /mnt.

    # mkfs.ext3 /dev/xvdb1
    # mount /dev/xvdb1 /mnt

Next we are going to create a NixOS system from the minimal installation
CD. We are going to mount the installation CD to \~/inst and create the
NixOS system in \~/host. This system will be used to install NixOS to
/mnt. For that we need the unsquashfs binary from squashfs-tools which
do not come with the default Gentoo installation. Install it using the
following commands.

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge squashfs-tools

Now you can download the latest minimal installation CD and create the
host system from it.

    # cd ~
    # mkdir inst host/nix/store
    # wget http://nixos.org/releases/nixos/latest-iso-minimal-x86_64-linux
    # modprobe loop
    # mount -o loop latest-iso-minimal-x86_64-linux inst
    # unsquashfs -d host/nix/store inst/nix-store.squashfs '*'

To have a working network connection, copy /etc/resolve.conf to the
host/nix/etc. For a proper chroot, you need to bind /dev, /proc and /sys
directories.

    # cp /etc/resolve.conf host/nix/etc/
    # mkdir host/dev host/proc host/sys
    # for fn in dev proc sys; do mount --bind /$fn host/fn; done

To properly chroot into the host system you must locate the packages
named nixos and bash. The following commands may prove helpful.

    # find host -type f -name init | grep nixos
    host/nix/store/abwlkvzyjd2i39b1l1wfv7v9ilx88fwi-nixos-0.1pre34067-34077/init
    # find host -type f -name bash | tail -n 1
    host/nix/store/bmgq2jrn6719r6j55gs4rzfp0azcbazy-bash-4.2-p24/bin/bash

Next we have to edit the host system's init file by removing the upstart
task and adding a bash session to it. Since upstart is started in the
last line, you might just replace that line with bash.

    # sed '$d' < echo "/nix/store/bmgq2jrn6719r6j55gs4rzfp0azcbazy-bash-4.2-p24/bin/bash" > host/nix/store/abwlkvzyjd2i39b1l1wfv7v9ilx88fwi-nixos-0.1pre34067-34077/init

Now we are able to chroot into the NixOS system used for installation.
Use the following command replacing the store path in case it has
changed. Futher commands to be executed in the chrooted environment will
be prefixed with "\# (chroot)".

    # chroot host /nix/store/abwlkvzyjd2i39b1l1wfv7v9ilx88fwi-nixos-0.1pre34067-34077/init

Installation is now straight forward. All you have to do is create a
suitable configuration file for booting. Below is a file pasted for
reference to get things started. Be sure to replace networking
information according to /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/net from the original
Cloud Server.

    # (chroot) nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
    # (chroot) $EDITOR /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

    {config, pkgs, modulesPath, ...}:

    {
      require = [
        "${modulesPath}/virtualisation/xen-domU.nix"
      ];

      networking = {
        useDHCP = false;
        defaultGateway = "209.61.142.1";
        nameservers = [ "72.3.128.240" "72.3.128.241" ];
        interfaces = [
          { ipAddress = "209.61.142.12";
            name = "eth0";
            subnetMask = "255.255.255.0";
          }

          { ipAddress = "10.180.133.23";
            name = "eth1";
            subnetMask = "255.255.128.0";
          }
        ];
      };

      fileSystems = [
        { mountPoint = "/";
          device = "/dev/xvda1";
          options = "noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro,barrier=0";
        }
      ];

      swapDevices = [
        { device = "/dev/xvdc1"; }
      ];

      services.openssh.enable = true;
    }

Before executing nixos-install you might want to run nixos-checkout to
obtain the most recent version of packages to be installed into your
NixOS system. You might need to copy /etc/resolv.conf from the rescue
system to the host system.

    # (chroot) nixos-checkout
    # (chroot) nixos-install

Now your system should be set up. Be sure to change the root password to
be able to login and double check that /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst is
present and looks sensible.

    # (chroot) passwd

Now you may exit Rescue Mode from your Rackspace's control panel and
have your new NixOS system boot. You may login via SSH using the root
account and password specified above.
