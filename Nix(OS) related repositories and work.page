For various reasons some work has not been committed to the main trunk
repositories. You find a description about some of them here:

Haskell overlay (stable)
------------------------

Let's you install nearly all hackage packages easily. Older and newer
gtk2hs supported. [hack-nix](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hack-Nix)
also provides a convenient way to setup multiple build environments for
a project
[nixpkgs-haskell-overlay](http://github.com/MarcWeber/nixpkgs-haskell-overlay)

Ruby overlay (stable)
---------------------

purpose: abstract away tedious task of finding matching versions and
packaging ruby packages. (source: RubyGems) Let's you install all
packages known by gem. (Contact Marc Weber if you want to try it, you
need some more patches).
[nixpkgs-ruby-overlay](https://gitorious.org/nixpkgs-ruby-overlay/)
Usage example (\~/.nixpkgs/config.nix)

       rubyEnv = 
         let ro = (pkgs.overlay "ruby");
         in ro.rubyEnv19 {
             p = {
                activesupport =  "=" "2.3.9" ;
             };
             # note: the gem dependencies of activesupport will be found automatically
             names = [ "activesupport" ];
         };

Note: if two packages resolve different versions of the same dependency
Nix fails. You can work around it by forcing a version as shown above.

Python overlay (experimental)
-----------------------------

purpose: abstract away tedious task of finding matching versions and
packaging python packages (source: PyPi package index) Let's you install
all packages known by gem. (Contact Marc Weber if you want to try it,
you need some more patches). Open issues: How to find out which package
has to be run with python-2.x or python-3 and such.
[nixpkgs-python-overlay](https://gitorious.org/nixpkgs-python-overlay/)

nixpkgs-utilities
-----------------

a very small collection of scripts you can run to verify that you don't
break too much when comitting. This is work in progress
[nixpkgs-dev-utilities](http://gitorious.org/nixpkgs-dev-utilities/).
Current goals:

-   verify that everything still evaluates
-   verify that most important things build on your system
-   preview of what will be rebuild if you change something

ocamlPackages
-------------

A small collections of [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/)-related packages:
[download](http://www.math.unifi.it/~maggesi/ocamlPackages).

Reasons for not committing it to trunk: Proof of concept, still
experimenting, trying to find a good way to cope with findlib and other
OCaml-specific practices.

nanonixos
---------

<http://viric.name/cgi-bin/nanonixos/> cross compiled nixos by Lluis
Batlle i Rossell

guix
----

A nixos version using guile scheme as scripting language instead of nix
initiated by Ludovic Courtes <http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/>
