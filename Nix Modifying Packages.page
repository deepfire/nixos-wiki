Sometimes we must modify an existing Nix expression to install the
software we need. For example, suppose a Nix expression exists for "Ruby
3.0.0p0", but we need the "Ruby 3.0.0p360" revision. How can we get this
newer revision of Ruby?

We have a few options to get a one-off Nix package when using Nix
expressions.

-   Fork the NixPkgs project and modify the package's Nix expression in
    your fork, then, optionally, push this modification back to the
    project.
-   Create a Nix expression which overrides existing Nix packages.

Fork and Modify NixPkgs
-----------------------

If we want to modify an existing package and we think the existing
package should no longer be used, we can modify the package and push
this update to the central NixPkgs repository. For a detailed
walk-through, see the [Contributing to
NixPkgs](//Contributing to nixpkgs) Wiki page, but for now, let's look
at the overview.

### Fork NixPkgs

Log into your GitHub account, or create one, then click the "Fork"
button on the central [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs%7CNixPkgs).

Clone your fork of the project to your computer to modify it and test
your changes.

       $ git clone https://github.com/your_username/nixpkgs.git ~/my-fork

### Modifying a Forked Package

Now you can modify a package. Open the
`~/my-fork/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix` file and find the
name of the package you want to modify from the set of attributes.
Consider Filezilla, for example, which is defined like this:
`filezilla = callPackage ../applications/networking/ftp/filezilla { };`.
To modify the Filezilla package, modify the
`../applications/networking/ftp/filezilla/default.nix` file, as
`default.nix` is the default file name used by Nix if not specified.

### Using Your Fork of NixPkgs

After modifying a package's Nix expression, we need to test it. When we
normally use Nix commands, such as the `nix-env -i` command, the default
NixPkgs installation is used. We can, however, specify a different
NixPkgs installation for Nix commands to use.

       ### Install from default NixPkgs:
       $ nix-env -i firefox

To specify a different NixPkgs installation, we need to add it to Nix's
search path, which is used to find Nix expressions. To do this, modify
the `NIX_PATH` environment variable to add a path alias, which looks
like "my-nixpkgs=/path/to/fork/nixpkgs". With this path alias defined,
we can use it to tell Nix to use our NixPkgs fork. To use the path alias
in Nix commands, place it inside angle brackets, like "`<my-nixpkgs>`",
when using Nix commands.

       ### Install from our NixPkgs fork: (yet to be tested by author)
       $ export NIX_PATH=my-nixpkgs=~/my-fork/nixpkgs:NIX_PATH
       $ nix-env -i <my-nixpkgs/default.nix> firefox
       $ nix-env -i <my-nixpkgs> firefox

If we have problems, we can individually execute each phase of the Nix
build process by using the `nix-shell` command.

       $ nix-shell ~/my-fork/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix -A firefox
       $ nix-shell <my-nixpkgs> -A firefox # (yet to be tested by author)
       [nix-shell]$ unpackPhase
       [nix-shell]$ patchPhase
       [nix-shell]$ configurePhase
       [nix-shell]$ buildPhase
       ...

For more information about debugging a Nix package, see the [Debugging a
Nix Package](//Debugging a Nix Package) and [Create and Debug Nix
Packages](//Create and debug nix packages) wiki pages.

After debugging the package, we can test the results of the build by
using the `nix-build` command or directly install it using the
`nix-env -i` command.

Overriding Existing Packages
----------------------------

If we don't want to create a fork of NixPkgs or we believe our
modifications will not be useful to other people, we can instead "patch"
our default NixPkgs installation.

When Nix evaluates the NixPkgs Nix expression, it will also evaluate the
file located at the `~/.nixpkgs/config.nix` path and combine it with the
default NixPkgs expression. If we want to use a different file, specify
a file path in the `NIXPKGS_CONFIG` environment variable and Nix will
instead use that one.

### Creating a `config.nix` File

What does Nix expect the `config.nix` file to look like? To modify
existing packages, it must accept `pkgs` as a parameter and have an
attribute named `packageOverrides`.

Here are some examples (yet to be tested by author).

       pkgs : {
         packageOverrides = pkgs : rec {
          myHaskellPackages =
            let callPackage = pkgs.lib.callPackageWith myHaskellPackages; in
              pkgs.recurseIntoAttrs (pkgs.haskellPackages.override {
                extraPrefs = self : {
                  boomerang = callPackage ./haskell/boomerang.nix {};
                };
              });
         };
       }

Or

       {
         packageOverrides = pkgs : with pkgs; {
           sdlEnv = pkgs.myEnvFun {
             name = "someEnvName";
             buildInputs = [ stdenv pkgconfig toolOne toolTwo toolThree ];
           };
         };
       }

For a closer look on exactly how Nix loads this config file, look at the
[`all-packages.nix: Line 54`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L54)
to see how it is retrieved and saved to the `config` attribute. To see
how this file is used to "patch" the existing packages, see
[`all-packages.nix: Line 108`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix#L108),
which uses its `packageOverrides` attribute to create the `pkgs`
attribute, which is used for the rest of the NixPkgs.
