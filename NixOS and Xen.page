[Xen](http://www.xen.org/) is a virtualisation system: it allows you to
run multiple virtual ("guest") machines concurrently on a single
physical ("host") machine. It supports both unmodified guest operating
systems on hosts with hardware virtualisation support, and
*paravirtualised* guest operating systems that communicate more
efficiently with the host system.

Virtual machines running on Xen are called *domains*. There always is a
special, privileged domain called Domain 0 (Dom0), which is responsible
for managing and accessing the host hardware (as the Xen kernel itself
has no disk or network drivers). The other, unprivileged domains are
called DomU. NixOS can run both in Dom0 and DomU.

Enabling Xen
------------

To enable the Xen hypervisor in a NixOS system, just enable the
following option in `configuration.nix`:

    virtualisation.xen.enable = true;

Then run `nixos-rebuild switch` and reboot. The system should now boot
Xen, with your NixOS system running as the privileged Domain 0 (Dom0).
You may also want to set the option
`virtualisation.xen.domain0MemorySize` to limit the amount of memory
reserved for Dom0, e.g.

    virtualisation.xen.domain0MemorySize = 512;
