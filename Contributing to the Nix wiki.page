O(1)
----

On the haskell mailinglist there was some discussion about their
[haskell.org wiki]. If you visit it it looks very crowded. However there
is a good reason for it. You can access all content by O(1) access no
matter whether you're an advanced user or a new user. I'd vote for O(1)
access on the main wiki page as well - Marc Weber

WISH LIST
---------

What is missing on the wiki? even if you don't have time let others know
who may have time what you think is missing. Should we group this by
author? Should we add kind of rating?

This is a list containing random notes right now. Add items yourself
here.

-   haskell on Nix howto. (Marc Weber is going to write this?)

### vim and .nix files. (Marc Weber is going to write this?)

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetect/
    NEW NEW NEW
    http://people.cs.uu.nl/andres/nix.vim
    NEW NEW NEW
    find / -name syntax/lisp.vim

Then use the found file an copy it to nix.vim

    cp /nix/store/jz5hjc8a8cl5x9pm40ib42bk13b4vazz-vim-7.3/share/vim/vim73/syntax/lisp.vim 

\~/.vim/ftdetect/nix.vim

    echo "syntax on" >> ~/.vimrc

**Note:** this is not exactly NIX syntax but looks much better than S/W
anyway!

Test your new setup:

    vi /etc/nixos/configuration.nix # should be highlighted

--[Invalidmagic](/w/index.php?title=User:Invalidmagic&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Invalidmagic (page does not exist)")

random notes
------------

What policies do we have ? Eg "Nix" and "NixOS" is the spelling which
should be used everywhere. What about links? Should they all start with
an upper case letter? Anyway. Keep this short because everyone is
supposed to read it!

Do we want subsections for different projects?

Eg [NixOS:Modules](//NixOS:Modules) using a colon (":") to separate the
project and the page contents? Or does Mediawiki allow [NixOS/Modules,
Don't create this
page](/w/index.php?title=NixOS/Modules&action=edit&redlink=1 "NixOS/Modules (page does not exist)")
as well using a slash?

It is possible configure MediaWiki to treat slashes as a hierarchy, but
I suspect we're better off using categories: [[Category:NixOS]] It is
also possible to have hierarchical categories but it gets a bit messy. I
really like the look of the Semantic MediaWiki extensions
<http://semantic-mediawiki.org> which allows for very rich
categorization and queries: e.g.
"[Concepts](http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Concepts)" (goibhniu)
