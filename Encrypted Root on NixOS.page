There are many possible encrypted root setups. This guide is for setting
up LVM over Luks, which is an easy and safe setup that will satisfy most
users. Other setups should still be sufficiently similar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luks got changed lately (see mailinglist from 3.3.2012 titled "[Nix-dev]
luks changes")

If you had:

     boot.initrd.luksRoot = "/dev/sda2";

Then now you have to write:

     boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: the configuration of /etc/nixos/configuration.nix")] the configuration of /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we assume that:

-   your **boot partition** is **/dev/sda1** and
-   your **luks-encrypted partition** is **/dev/sda2** that contains the
    LVM volume group "vg".

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Make sure initrd finds and mounts the root partition")] Make sure initrd finds and mounts the root partition

The current implementation always opens the luks devices in the stage1
(before mounting the rootfs).

This part of configuration.nix will make cryptsetup luksOpen to be
called after the LVM initialisation for /dev/sda2 to the name
'luksroot':

      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

You can extend the list, if you have for example a ciphered swap
partition too, or any else:

      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [
        { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; }
        { name = "swap"; device = "/dev/sda3"; }
      ];

Notice that you will have to set the root filesystem to be mounted from
the device /dev/mapper/luksroot, and the swap enabled for the device
/dev/mapper/swap. Or, if you set labels, you can use the labels.

In case you had luks \*over\* LVM, you want to luksOpen the device
\*before\* lvm vgscan gets called:

      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [
        { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; preLVM = true; }
      ];

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: creating encrypted swap")] creating encrypted swap

If you don't use LVM then you have a problem with creating and using an
encrypted swap. One approach would be to unlock the swap partition with
a keyfile instead of a random key:

First create a normal encrpyted partition and after unlocking it, format
it as swap space using mkswap.

      cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdXY
      cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdXY swap
      mkswap /dev/mapper/swap

Then create a keyfile for auto-unlocking swap and store it in the root
folder (if this is your first installation store it in /mnt/root/) and
add it to the swap partition

      dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/keyfile bs=1024 count=1
      chmod 0400 /root/keyfile
      cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdXY /root/keyfile

Then, in this case, you can't benefit from the current boot.initrd.luks,
because it does not support keyfile. As in the stage1 the rootfs gets
mounted to /mnt-root, you can use this postMountCommands to get the swap
dmcrypt device opened.

      boot.initrd.postMountCommands = "cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file /mnt-root/root/keyfile /dev/sdaXY swap";
      swapDevices = [
        { device = "/dev/mapper/swap"; }
      ];

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: no encrypted root filesystem, no encrypted swap but only encrypted /home")] no encrypted root filesystem, no encrypted swap but only encrypted /home

If you **only want to have an encrypted home directory**, you need to
set something like this, for example:

      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { device = "/dev/sda3"; name = "lukshome"; };

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Extra kernel modules you might need")] Extra kernel modules you might need

Most of crypto modules are loaded by default so there's nothing to do.
However, if decryption fails or if you want to make sure everything is
going to work, run

    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2

What you are looking for is this:

    LUKS header information for /dev/sda2

    Version:        1
    Cipher name:    aes
    Cipher mode:    cbc-essiv:sha256
    Hash spec:      sha1

In this example you need SHA1, SHA256, AES, and CBC. All of these are
loaded by default, but if they were not, you could put the required
crypto modules into initrd like this:

    boot.initrd.luks.cryptoModules = ["aes" "sha256" "sha1" "cbc"];

Note that some USB keyboards also need special kernel support, which
must be available in the init ramdisk to enter the pass phrase. Recent
models of the Microsoft Internet keyboard, for example, need the module
`hid_microsoft` in order to be recognized as an input device.

### [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Encrypted_Root_on_NixOS&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Defending against DMA Attacks")] Defending against DMA Attacks

If you enable LUKS root, DMA attack mitigation is also
enabled(boot.initrd.luks.mitigateDMAAttacks ). It consists of
blacklisting firewire drivers. If you still need to use a firewire
device, you can manually modprobe the required drivers but don't forget
to unload them. With firewire drivers loaded(even if you don't have a
firewire port), your encryption key can be obtained in a couple of
minutes by an unsophisticated attacker with physical access to the
computer.

      } {
        mountPoint = "/boot";

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within the rescue system:

      # cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 crypt
      # vgscan
      # vgchange -ay

Now your logical volumes should be available.
