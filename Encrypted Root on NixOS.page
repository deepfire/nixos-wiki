There are many possible encrypted root setups. This guide is for setting
up LVM over Luks, which is an easy and safe setup that will satisfy most
users. Other setups should still be sufficiently similar.

Important
---------

Here you will find \*only\* NixOS-specific bits. For general information
regarding this setup, how to partition disks and such refer to
[[1]](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_Encryption_with_LUKS_for_dm-crypt)
or other detailed guide.

Updating from how it was previously
-----------------------------------

Luks got changed lately (see mailinglist from 3.3.2012 titled "[Nix-dev]
luks changes")

     If you had:
     boot.initrd.luksRoot = "/dev/sda2";
     
     Then now you have to write:
     boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
     boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

the configuration of /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
-------------------------------------------------

In this example we assume that:

-   your **boot partition** is **/dev/sda1** and
-   your **luks-encrypted partition** is **/dev/sda2** that contains the
    LVM volume group "vg".

### Make sure initrd finds and mounts the root partition

The current implementation always opens the luks devices in the stage1
(before mounting the rootfs).

This part of configuration.nix will make cryptsetup luksOpen to be
called after the LVM initialisation for /dev/sda2 to the name
'luksroot':

      boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [ { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; } ];

You can extend the list, if you have for example a ciphered swap
partition too, or any else:

      boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
      boot.initrd.luks.devices = [
        { name = "luksroot"; device = "/dev/sda2"; }
        { name = "swap"; device = "/dev/sda3"; }
      ];

### creating encrypted swap

If you don't use lvm2 then you have a problem with creating and using an
encrypted swap. One approach would be to unlock the swap partition with
a keyfile instead of a random key:

First create a normal encrpyted partition and after unlocking it, format
it as swap space using mkswap.

      cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdXY
      cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdXY swap
      mkswap /dev/mapper/swap

Then create a keyfile for auto-unlocking swap and store it in the root
folder (if this is your first installation store it in /mnt/root/) and
add it to the swap partition

      dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/keyfile bs=1024 count=1
      chmod 0400 /root/keyfile
      cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdXY /root/keyfile

Then enhance your configuration.nix with the following

      boot.initrd.postMountCommands = "cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file /mnt-root/root/keyfile /dev/sdaXY swap";
      swapDevices = [
        { device = "/dev/mapper/swap"; }
      ];

### no encrypted root filesystem, no encrypted swap but only encrypted /home

If you **only want to have an encrypted home directory**, you need to
set:

      boot.initrd.luks.enable = true;
      boot.initrd.postDeviceCommands = "cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 lukshome";

**Note: don't forget the kernel modules listed below**

### Extra kernel modules you might need

Depending on the encryption algorithm you have chosen for your Luks
volume, you will probably need to ensure kernel has the necessary crypto
modules.

If you are unsure which ones, run

    cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2

What you are looking for is this:

    LUKS header information for /dev/sda2

    Version:        1
    Cipher name:    aes
    Cipher mode:    cbc-essiv:sha256
    Hash spec:      sha1

In this example you need SHA1, SHA256, AES, and CBC.

You can put the required crypto modules into initrd along with dm\_crypt
module needed by Luks like this:

    boot.initrd.kernelModules = ["dm_crypt" "aes-i586" "sha256" "sha1" "cbc"];

On my 64bit system (2.6.32) I needed this modules instead the listed
above:

    boot.initrd.kernelModules = ["dm_crypt" "sha256_generic" "sha1_generic" "cbc" "aes_x86_64" "aes_generic" "xts" ];

 Note that some USB keyboards also need special kernel support, which
must be available in the init ramdisk to enter the pass phrase. Recent
models of the Microsoft Internet keyboard, for example, need the module
`hid_microsoft` in order to be recognized as an input device.

### Root Filesystem

      fileSystems = [ {
        mountPoint = "/";
        device = "/dev/mapper/vg-root";
        #device = "/dev/mapper/luksroot"; # use this instead when NOT using LVM
      } {
        mountPoint = "/boot";
        device = "/dev/sda1";
      }
      #other filesystems go here 
      ]

Mounting from a rescue system
-----------------------------

Within the rescue system:

      # cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 crypt
      # vgscan
      # vgchange -ay

Now your logical volumes should be available.
