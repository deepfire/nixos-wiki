This page [needs editing](//Category:Edit Needed). It may contain errors
and/or outdated information.

This page is intended to describe the current state of Steam under Nixos
and to discuss what the problems are in packaging it and how we can
approach solving them.

Description of the package
--------------------------

Steam is distributed as a .deb file, for now only as an i686 package
(the amd64 package only has documentation). When unpacked, it has a
script called steam that in ubuntu (their target distro) would go to
/usr/bin. When run for the first time, this script copies some files to
the user's home, which include another script that is the ultimate
responsible for launching the steam binary, which is also in \$HOME.

Nix problems and constraints
----------------------------

-   We don't have /bin/bash and many scripts point there. Similarly for
    /usr/bin/python, for some functionality.
-   We don't have the dynamic loader in /lib
-   The steam.sh script in \$HOME could not be patched last I tried, as
    it is checked and rewritten by steam
-   The steam binary cannot be patched, it's also checked

Approaches
----------

### Link bash to /bin and glibc/lib to /lib and be happy

-   Pros: easy, works
-   Cons: not very nix-compliant

### Workaround the scripts and launch steam directly

-   Pros: not so hard
-   Cons: this only solves the part concerned with running steam. What
    about the games? We can patch some of them, but at least Team
    Fortress is checked and rewritten if modified

This is the approach that I (page) took in my github branch:
<https://github.com/cpages/nixpkgs/tree/steam>

### Intercept Steam's calls with LD\_PRELOAD or the like

-   Pros: more robust
-   Cons: difficult to achieve and may be broken by changes in the
    binary

aszlig started working in this in his branch:
<https://github.com/aszlig/nixpkgs/tree/steam>

### chroot

-   Pros:
    -   it would allow us to have binaries in the expected paths without
        disrupting the system
    -   Steam itself, as well as Valve games and perhaps others like to
        checksum their executables, so patching does not work
-   Cons: performance?

shlevy/aristid proposed this approach. Noone has tried :)

I want to play
--------------

Ok, now for the fun part. This is the procedure that should allow you to
play:

1.  Install steam (nix-env -i steam). Might take some time
2.  Launch steam: the first run will install stuff to your home, and end
    up failing with wrong interpreter bla bla bla...
3.  Launch steam again: if all went well, you should end up with steam
    auto-updating itself. When it finishes, it won't automatically start
4.  Launch steam once more: this should present you with the login
    screen, and from here to a working steam

### But what about the games?

You can install any of the games normally, but they will fail to start.
From this step on, you're in the unsupported realm. Some games can be
patchelfed:

     patchelf --set-interpreter /path/to/ld.so game_binary (you can get the path to an x86 ld.so looking at the steam script in the store, for me /nix/store/xh0q23rgqbjfrh3zfv4jyxvcvjnxqh64-glibc-2.15.0/lib/ld-linux.so.2)

You might also need patching some scripts. That all depends on each one.
You can then press play from steam and if you're lucky that'll be it!

Troubleshooting
---------------

I was sure you would reach this part.

### Steam fails to start. What do I do?

strace is your friend.

### Game X fails to start

Games may fail to start because they lack dependencies (this should be
added to the script, for now), or because they cannot be patched. The
steps to launch a game directly are:

1.  Patch the script/binary if you can
2.  Add a file named steam\_appid.txt in the binary folder, with the
    appid as contents (it can be found in the stdout from steam)
3.  Using the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH from the nix/store steam script, with
    some additions, launch the game binary

<!-- -->

     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.steam/bin32:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/nix/store/pfsa... blabla ...curl-7.29.0/lib:. ./Osmos.bin32 (if you could not patchelf the game, call ld.so directly with the binary as param)

With this technique, I can play many games directly from steam. Others,
like Team Fortress, cannot be patched so I only managed to run them from
the cmd line.
