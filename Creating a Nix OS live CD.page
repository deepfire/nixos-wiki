motivation
----------

creating a modified NIXOS live CD out of a working nixos installation
gives you the benefits:

-   verify what is included
-   no need to download it
-   it is easy to add your own programs to the image

how to build such an image
--------------------------

just run this command:

    nix-build -A iso_minimal /etc/nixos/nixos/release.nix

once the building process is over, there will be a path like this:

-   /nix/store/2y4bivmrzg4d2dgby2b7prvfj7445088-nixos-iso-0.1pre1234/

use this command:

    cat /nix/store/2y4bivmrzg4d2dgby2b7prvfj7445088-nixos-iso-0.1pre1234/nix-support/hydra-build-products 
    file iso /nix/store/94rrfklbk2hcqhkr4627vsrlprlyva50-iso9660-image/iso/nixos-minimal-0.1pre1234-i686-linux-test.iso

and copy the new image from there.

adding additional software to the image
---------------------------------------

the basic script **/etc/nixos/nixos/release.nix** contains several entry
points for custom images. as we are using **-A iso\_minimal** have a
look at: iso\_minimal which will redirect us to:

-   ./modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix -\>
    /etc/nixos/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix

<!-- -->

    # This module defines a small NixOS installation CD.  It does not
    # contain any graphical stuff.
    {config, pkgs, ...}:
    {
      require = [
        ./installation-cd-base.nix
        ../../profiles/minimal.nix
      ];
    }

### step 1/3: starting ssh automatically in the image and adding a ssh key to it

setting a default password on the boot cdrom (so that nobody can login
using the default 'unset' password: TODO

### step 2/3: starting ssh automatically in the image and adding a ssh key to it

this is a hack, however it surely gives you an idea how to modify the
stuff there:

in
**/etc/nixos/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-base.nix**
add:

           mkdir -p /root/.ssh/
           echo 'ssh-rsa ssh-rsa  AAAAB3Nz...(cut here)...AzV foo@bar' > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

at the end of

-   boot.postBootCommands =

### step 3/3: starting ssh automatically in the image and adding a ssh key to it

**THIS IS NOT WORKING YET: IGNORE LINES BELOW**

    vi /etc/nixos/nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd/system-tarball-pc.nix

comment this line with a leading '\#':

    jobs.openssh.startOn = "network interfaces started";

software installation inside the 'once' deployed and booted image
-----------------------------------------------------------------

in case you have booted from your image you can add software as
described here:

-   [install/remove software](//Install/remove software)

Without NixOS you need to supply the
[source](https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixos/trunk/) instead of
/etc/nixos/nixos.
