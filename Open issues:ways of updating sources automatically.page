purpose: jumping to homepages getting source and name of the latest
version takes time. So we want to automate this.

Like Tobias Hunger said (and maybe someone else before) we may want to
consider learning or utilizing uscan. (Link?)

The following implementations exist:

Summary: nix-instantiate evaluates nixpkgs. The resulting (huge) XML is
parsed by a scheme helper application finding gnu packages and updating
their sources. Eelco Dolstra argued that the update information could be
put into the meta description so that more ways of updating packages can
be added. It currently updates gnu packages only (?)

Marc Weber's comments: The idea is great. However it depends on
evaluation of nixpkgs which can be different depending on configuration
options. Also if you put update information into the meta attributes
which are not passed to the builder there are many lines between the
sorce declaration and the update information. So its easy to miss.

Summary: The update information which basically consists of url of html
page containing update links a regex extracting them is put into a .nix
file. A shell script then evaluates the .nix expression gathering that
data, downloading the page finding the latest version. The updated
information is then put in yet another file which is imported by
default.nix. Example: webkit.

Marc Weber's comments: I dislike many small files. When merging branches
or deleting packages they cause more work. Also many small files take
longer to seek on non SSD disks and fill up more disk space ? I'm not
sure those are strong arguments. I've put a clone of the script into my
nixpkgs-utilities (gitorious) repository adding a --help option.

AFAIK Eelco Dolstra also dislikes having many small files for this
purpose.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[github](http://github.com/MarcWeber/nix-repository-manager) basic idea:
Keep it simple. Text regions are introduced which start by special
markers which are commented lines. The comments contain information
about how to update the region in a Nix attr like format. An example is
HaXe. There are two phases for updating a package:

\(1) clone /update remote (git,hg,...) repository into a local directory
and create .tar.gz for testing

\(2) upload .tar.gz publishing it

Its you choosing between using the testing or published version by
configuration option.

Example taken from HaXe:

       src_haxe_swflib = {
         # REGION AUTO UPDATE:                                { name = "haxe_swflib"; type="cvs"; cvsRoot = ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.motion-twin.com:/cvsroot"; module = "ocaml/swflib"; groups = "haxe_group"; }
         src = sourceFromHead "haxe_swflib-F_10-43-46.tar.gz"
                      (fetchurl { url = "http://mawercer.de/~nix/repos/haxe_swflib-F_10-43-46.tar.gz"; sha256 = "a63de75e48bf500ef0e8ef715d178d32f0ef113ded8c21bbca698a8cc70e7b58"; });
         # END
       }.src;

Marc Weber's comments: I wrote it and I still prefer it because the
update information is nearby the source so you can't miss it. However
care should be taken that the contents of the regions don't exceed a
couple of lines so that its easy to see that its a region. That .tar.gz
files are created (and not fetchGit etc) are used can be controversal:

+ fast download, always works (unless my mirror for those .tar.gz
packages goes down)

+ fast updates because VCS updates are incremental

+ supports hack-nix

- its harder to verify that I didn't manipulate the source packages - so
you have to trust me.

I plan to support Michael Raskins feature in the near future getting
links by xpath from HTML pages selecting the newest version. It can be
installed easily using the

Marc Weber's comments: None. I haven't had time to look into it. v2 also
uses evaluation so it also suffers from the configuration issue.

Tobias Hunger's comments: The script extracts the following attributes
from the XML:

-   name (for name and version information)
-   watchfile (for a debian/watch file to use for the actual updating
    process as well as the .nix file name to update)
-   src/url[s] (in case we want to update the URL)
-   src/hash value and type (to replace the hash later)
-   url\_mangler (version 3): Used to e.g. change the url from uscan to
    nixos mirror:// syntax. This is optional.

There is no extra update information is needed inside the nix
expressions. It seems to work reasonably well with the files I treid to
convert so far (about 15 or so).

The watch file is an extra small file of course, but having it enables
me to use debian's uscan utility to actually figure out all the update
information instead of reinventing the wheel. Uscan is widely used
inside debian and has special magic to support sites like sourceforge,
etc. and even can be used to extract package information from download
pages meant for humans (e.g. bzip2 or zlib).

Status so far:

-   Extracting information from the nix expressions works great
-   Finding updates is very solid
-   Updating the nix expression is still not perfect, especially with
    files wile the one found in pkgs/server/x11/xorg which has lots of
    derivations defined in it. There still is a chance that my script
    ends up replacing the wrong things there. I need to find a way to
    improve that.

Update: Version 3 should be pretty robust wrt. the version number it
replaces. I am rather happy with it so far, having converted about 60
derivations to use my system:-)
