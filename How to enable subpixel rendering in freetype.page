Why
===

Nixos doesn't enable subpixel rendering by default because it is covered
by patents. From the FreeType source code:

    Note that this feature is covered by several Microsoft
    patents and should not be activated in any default
    build of the library.

How to enable
=============

Let's see the definition of freetype in top-level.nix:

      freetype = callpackage ../development/libraries/freetype {
         useEncumberedCode = getconfig [ "freetype" "useencumberedcode" ] false;
      };

it shows that freetype has useEncumberedCode option set to false by
default. Enabling it in config does the job, but leads to mass local
rebuilding of packages which are depend on freetype. Probably, it is not
what user expects so we need a trick.

### Configuration.nix

Define new instance of freetype expression (with another and uniq name)
and include it in the config. Here are parts of configuration.nix:

      nixpkgs.config = {
        packageOverrides = pkgs: {
          ...

          freetype_subpixel = pkgs.freetype.override {
            useEncumberedCode = true;
          };

          ...
        }
      }

Next, we should add it to the list of system packages to force building
and linking into /run/current-system/sw/:

      environment.systemPackages = with pkgs ; [
        ...
        freetype_subpixel
      ];

### LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

freetype\_subpixel is our new version of freetype, with subpixel
rendering enabled. Now we should tell others to link with it instead of
system default.

Basically, user has to insert following lines into right place:

    FREETYPE=$(dirname $(readlink /run/current-system/sw/lib/libfreetype.so))
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$FREETYPE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Some DEs, like KDE, read special .files to make trics like that
possible. AFAIK, there is no such option for xfce, so I've patched the
session startup:

    -------------- modules/services/x11/display-managers/default.nix --------------
    index cdfd271..4805eb5 100644
    @@ -91,6 +91,10 @@ let
               fi
           fi
     
    +      if test -f ~/.xprofile; then
    +          . ~/.xprofile
    +      fi
    +
           # The session type is "<desktop-manager> + <window-manager>", so
           # extract those.
           windowManager="''${sessionType##* + }"

Now my nixos sources .xprofile each time before logging in. So I put the
snippet there.

### That's it

Rebuild the system and reboot. env should look like this:

    $ env | grep LD_LIBR
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/nix/store/jxss54j52paqwns8zvm6mwr7f89ck7ya-freetype-2.4.4/lib:/run/opengl-driver/lib:/run/opengl-driver-32/lib
