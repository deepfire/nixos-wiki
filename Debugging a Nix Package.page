Writing a Nix expression to define a new package can be quite a
challenge. What tools and techniques can we use when writing a Nix
package?

What problem do we want to solve?

-   I think a Nix package looks good. How can I test the packaged
    software without installing it?
-   I can't successfully build a package. How can I step through the
    build phases Nix uses?

Build Without Installing
------------------------

Suppose we want to use some software from NixPkgs, but we don't want to
install it. How can we install the software without installing it into
our user environment?

Why do we want to prevent a normal installation? If we are debugging a
Nix expression, we want to repeatedly modify it and test the results.
Each time we modify the Nix expression, the package's hash changes,
which will create a new entry in the Nix store, which is unavoidable.
However, a normal package installation also creates a second entry in
the Nix store, which can be prevented - a new user environment.

When we normally install software from a Nix package, we use the
`nix-env -i` command, which creates a new user environment to include
the new software. If we are debugging a package's Nix expression, we may
use this command dozens of times, which will create dozens of user
environments in the Nix store. Even if we don't mind this waste, the
practice of installing unstable software into our normal user
environment is questionable. We should avoid this practice if possible.

Nix provides the `nix-build` command to build and install a Nix package
without modifying a user's environment. Because it doesn't place this
software into the user environment, we can not access it using
command-line shortcuts. That is, instead of using the `chromium`
command, we must specify its full path,
`/nix/store/7xn0yg2n8g1jfqmyk6mh71p0bnya8nng-chromium-30.0.1599.114-with-plugins/bin/chromium`.
To solve this problem, the `nix-build` command will create a link to it
named `result`.

Here's an example of using `nix-build`.

       $ nix-build /my-sources/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix -A hello
       these paths will be fetched (0.04 MiB download, 0.20 MiB unpacked):
         /nix/store/d4ccnxjm73yiqg85nyyyqhybrhrqykn3-hello-2.8
       (...building...)
       /nix/store/d4ccnxjm73yiqg85nyyyqhybrhrqykn3-hello-2.8

Now, we have the `hello` software built and installed. How do we use it?
If we look in the current directory, we can see a `result` link was
created. We can use this to easily explore the results of the build and
use the built software.

       $ ls -l result
       lrwxrwxrwx 1 username username 53 Nov 27 10:35 result -> /nix/store/d4ccnxjm73yiqg85nyyyqhybrhrqykn3-hello-2.8
       
       $ hello
       The program ‘hello’ is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
         nix-env -i hello
       
       $ result/bin/hello 
       Hello, world!

This is a very useful tool, indeed. We can explore the package's
resulting build without installing the software into our environment.

Step Through Build Phases
-------------------------

Suppose the resulting build of a Nix package does not work as we expect,
and we suspect a file is installed to the wrong path. How can we inspect
the Nix's build process to see how the build result is created?

When Nix builds a package, it organizes the build steps into several
"phases", documented in the [NixPkgs Manual: Phases
section](http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#ssec-stdenv-phases). Nix
provides the `nix-shell` command which enables us to manually execute
each of these phases and see its effects. Examples of some important
phases are `unpackPhase`, `configurePhase`, `buildPhase`, and
`installPhase`. First, let's enter the build environment using
`nix-shell`.

       nix-shell /my-sources/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix -A hello
       these derivations will be built:
         /nix/store/kzr1q8i10a4lpxgyjg4zpf76rh2mzjr8-hello-2.8.tar.gz.drv
       (...building dependencies...)
       [nix-shell:~]$ 

Now, let's try to step through a build by manually executing its phases.

       [nix-shell]$ unpackPhase
       [nix-shell]$ cd hello-2.8/
       [nix-shell]$ ls
       [nix-shell]$ configurePhase
       (...configure info...)
       [nix-shell]$ buildPhase
       (...build info...)
       [nix-shell]$ installPhase
       (...install info...)

After each of these phases, we can see the effect by using the `ls`
command to inspect the build directory. Note that to write to the Nix
store, which occurs in the `installPhase`, the running user must be root
or the owner of the `/nix/store` directory.
