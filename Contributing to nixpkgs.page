Overview
--------

This is the easiest and more straightforward way I know to modify and
expand [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/). I have annoyed many
people, specially [Viric](//User:Viric), to get to this point. I hope
this article will help future newbies so the experts can focus on other
stuff.

This document is not intended as a formal approach to learn
[nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/),
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) or *systems administration*. It is
just a sort of tutorial for newbies to be able to easily fix and
contribute trivial improvements. I believe this approach will help
newbies such as myself to get (slowly and inefficiently) educated on the
*nix language*, the *nix package manager* and *NixOS*.

The official nixpkgs sources are managed on a [git](http://git-scm.com/)
repository at [GitHub](https://github.com). And GitHub implements most
of the tools for the nixpkgs development workflow.

*All operations explained on this document, if tested, have been tested
on a [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) system.*

Cloning the "NixOS/nixpkgs" repository on GitHub
------------------------------------------------

-   I had to sign up at GitHub. This is free (as in beer) as of
    2013-03-20.
-   Then I visited [the official nixpkgs
    repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and hit the *fork*
    button.
-   This results in your own somewhat-independent repository:
    `https://github.com/your_username/nixpkgs`

Retrieving a working copy of your repository
--------------------------------------------

-   Now you can clone your repository somewhere on your system:

        mkdir ~/devel/ && cd ~/devel/ && git clone https://github.com/your_username/nixpkgs.git

-   You should get a git repository with the whole nixpkgs tree under
    `~/devel/nixpkgs/`
-   Unless explicitly stated, for the rest of the document we are
    working from this directory:

        cd ~/devel/nixpkgs/

-   Just to ensure everything is clear, on this directory there should
    be two main entries: the `default.nix` file and the `pkgs/`
    directory.
-   From now on, `pkgs/` will refer to this `nixpkgs/pkgs/` so if you
    keep the equivalent of `~/devel/nixpkgs/` as your CWD (current
    working directory), most commands and pathnames can be copied and
    pasted in real life.
-   So for example, on this document `pkgs/top-level/` refers to
    `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/`
-   This looks perhaps too verbose, but I feel this extra context would
    have clarified many ambiguous explanations to me.
-   Also, when talking about directories I will try to always include
    the trailing slash.

Following the white rabbit
--------------------------

-   I will center this tutorial on the nix expression that packages the
    [i3 window manager](http://i3wm.org/), as this expression is quite
    simple and it was contributing to this expression that I got to
    understand this whole workflow I am documenting.
-   In `~/devel/nixpkgs/default.nix` there is an *import* statement that
    reads `import ./pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`
-   I have the feeling that most references between nix sources (*nix
    expressions*) in *nixpkgs* are stated as relative paths pointing up
    and down the `nixpkgs/` directory hierarchy.
-   Please have a look at this `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`. There
    are many more or less complex definitions at the beginning, and then
    a shitload of declarations such as:

<!-- -->

    i3       = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3 { };
    i3lock   = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3/lock.nix { };
    i3status = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3/status.nix { };

-   Now let's have a look at the contents of
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/`:

<!-- -->

    $ ls -1 pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/
    default.nix
    lock.nix
    status.nix

-   The first assignment `i3 = callPackage ...` refers implicitly to
    `default.nix` on the `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/`
    directory.
-   The second and third assignments are explicitly referring to
    `lock.nix` and `status.nix` files on this
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/` directory.
-   Each of these three files contain somewhat equivalent *nix
    expressions* that the *nix package manager* will consider as
    *packages* thanks to the `callPackage` on
    `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.

The actual package "recipe"
---------------------------

-   We will dive (not too deep, though) on
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix` which is the nix
    expression that corresponds to the package for the i3 window
    manager:

<!-- -->

    { fetchurl, stdenv, which, pkgconfig, libxcb, xcbutilkeysyms, xcbutil,
      xcbutilwm, libstartup_notification, libX11, pcre, libev, yajl,
      libXcursor, coreutils, perl, pango }:

    stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
      name = "i3-${version}";
      version = "4.5.1";

      src = fetchurl {
        url = "http://i3wm.org/downloads/${name}.tar.bz2";
        sha256 = "bae55f1c7c4a21d71aae182e4fab6038ba65ba4be5d1ceff9e269f4f74b823f2";
      };

      buildInputs = [ which pkgconfig libxcb xcbutilkeysyms xcbutil xcbutilwm
        libstartup_notification libX11 pcre libev yajl libXcursor perl pango ];

      patchPhase = ''
        patchShebangs
      '';

      configurePhase = "makeFlags=PREFIX=$out";

      meta = {
        description = "i3 is a tiling window manager";
        homepage = "http://i3wm.org";
        maintainers = [ stdenv.lib.maintainers.garbas ];
        license = stdenv.lib.licenses.bsd3;
      };
    }

-   As an example of the trivial fixes and improvements I was talking
    about, you can have a look at two changesets I did:
    -   adding the *pango* dependency to [enable antialiased fonts on
        i3](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/f976962d7b7087920a6635ca90f07b06e8a44202)
    -   and [updating from upstream version 4.5 to
        4.5.1](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/ae9b33ac51dee8b24479cbdb54fe8d752a912ce4)
-   As I anticipated above, I am not going to explain what's the purpose
    of the list of `buildInputs`, how a list enclosed by square brackets
    separated by spaces differs from the list at the beginning or the
    relevance of the colon that follows its closing curly brace. I just
    don't know so much *yet*.
