Overview
--------

This is the easiest and more straightforward way I know to modify and
expand [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/). I have annoyed many
people, specially [Viric](//User:Viric), to get to this point. I hope
this article will help future newbies so the experts can focus on other
stuff.

This document is not intended as a formal approach to learn
[nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), [nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/),
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) or *systems administration*. It is
just a sort of tutorial for newbies to be able to easily fix and
contribute trivial improvements. I believe this approach will help
newbies such as myself to get (slowly and inefficiently) educated on the
*nix language*, the *nix package manager* and *NixOS*.

The official nixpkgs sources are managed on a [git](http://git-scm.com/)
repository at [GitHub](https://github.com). And GitHub implements most
of the tools for the nixpkgs development workflow.

*All operations explained on this document, if tested, have been tested
on a [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/) system.*

Cloning the "NixOS/nixpkgs" repository on GitHub
------------------------------------------------

-   I had to sign up at GitHub. This is free (as in beer) as of
    2013-03-20.
-   Then I visited [the official nixpkgs
    repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and hit the *fork*
    button.
-   This results in your own somewhat-independent repository:
    `https://github.com/your_username/nixpkgs`

Retrieving a working copy of your repository
--------------------------------------------

-   Now you can clone your repository somewhere on your system:

        mkdir ~/devel/ && cd ~/devel/ && git clone https://github.com/your_username/nixpkgs.git

-   You should get a git repository with the whole nixpkgs tree under
    `~/devel/nixpkgs/`
-   Unless explicitly stated, for the rest of the document we are
    working from this directory:

        cd ~/devel/nixpkgs/

-   Just to ensure everything is clear, on this directory there should
    be two main entries: the `default.nix` file and the `pkgs/`
    directory.
-   From now on, `pkgs/` will refer to this `nixpkgs/pkgs/` so if you
    keep the equivalent of `~/devel/nixpkgs/` as your CWD (current
    working directory), most commands and pathnames can be copied and
    pasted in real life.
-   So for example, on this document `pkgs/top-level/` refers to
    `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/`
-   This looks perhaps too verbose, but I feel this extra context would
    have clarified many ambiguous explanations to me.
-   Also, when talking about directories I will try to always include
    the trailing slash.

Following the white rabbit
--------------------------

-   I will center this tutorial on the nix expression that packages the
    [i3 window manager](http://i3wm.org/), as this expression is quite
    simple and it was contributing to this expression that I got to
    understand this whole workflow I am documenting.
-   In `~/devel/nixpkgs/default.nix` there is an *import* statement that
    reads `import ./pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`
-   I have the feeling that most references between nix sources (*nix
    expressions*) in *nixpkgs* are stated as relative paths pointing up
    and down the `nixpkgs/` directory hierarchy.
-   Please have a look at this `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`. There
    are many more or less complex definitions at the beginning, and then
    a shitload of declarations such as:

<!-- -->

    i3       = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3 { };
    i3lock   = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3/lock.nix { };
    i3status = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3/status.nix { };

and

    pango = callPackage ../development/libraries/pango/1.30.x.nix { };

-   Now let's have a look at the contents of
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/`:

<!-- -->

    $ ls -1 pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/
    default.nix
    lock.nix
    status.nix

-   The first assignment `i3 = callPackage ...` refers implicitly to
    `default.nix` on the `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/`
    directory.
-   The second and third assignments are explicitly referring to
    `lock.nix` and `status.nix` files on this
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/` directory.
-   Each of these three files contain somewhat equivalent *nix
    expressions* that the *nix package manager* will consider as
    *packages* thanks to the `callPackage` on
    `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.

The actual package "recipe"
---------------------------

-   We will dive (not too deep, though) on
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix` which is the nix
    expression that corresponds to the package for the i3 window
    manager:

<!-- -->

    { fetchurl, stdenv, which, pkgconfig, libxcb, xcbutilkeysyms, xcbutil,
      xcbutilwm, libstartup_notification, libX11, pcre, libev, yajl,
      libXcursor, coreutils, perl, pango }:

    stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
      name = "i3-${version}";
      version = "4.5.1";

      src = fetchurl {
        url = "http://i3wm.org/downloads/${name}.tar.bz2";
        sha256 = "bae55f1c7c4a21d71aae182e4fab6038ba65ba4be5d1ceff9e269f4f74b823f2";
      };

      buildInputs = [ which pkgconfig libxcb xcbutilkeysyms xcbutil xcbutilwm
        libstartup_notification libX11 pcre libev yajl libXcursor perl pango ];

      patchPhase = ''
        patchShebangs
      '';

      configurePhase = "makeFlags=PREFIX=$out";

      meta = {
        description = "i3 is a tiling window manager";
        homepage = "http://i3wm.org";
        maintainers = [ stdenv.lib.maintainers.garbas ];
        license = stdenv.lib.licenses.bsd3;
      };
    }

-   As an example of the trivial fixes and improvements I was talking
    about, you can have a look at two changesets (*commits* in the *git*
    terminology) I did:
    -   adding the *pango* dependency to [enable antialiased fonts on
        i3](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/f976962d7b7087920a6635ca90f07b06e8a44202)
    -   and [updating from upstream version 4.5 to
        4.5.1](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/ae9b33ac51dee8b24479cbdb54fe8d752a912ce4)
-   As I anticipated above, I am not going to explain what's the purpose
    of the list of `buildInputs`, how a list enclosed by square brackets
    separated by spaces differs from the list at the beginning or the
    relevance of the colon that follows its closing curly brace. I just
    don't know so much *yet*.

Making changes
--------------

-   On your local clone of your forked repository you can edit whatever
    you want.
-   That is, in our example, under `~/devel/nixpkgs/`
-   As you can see on the *commits* cited above I edited
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix`. I did several
    changes at once:
    -   Added `pango` to both dependency lists. This `pango` refers to
        `pango = callPackage ...` in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`
    -   Changed the `version` string.
    -   Changed the checksum for the tarball on the `sha256` string.
    -   Removed a line on the `patchPhase` string. This line was a `sed`
        command which was erasing some lines from the file `common.mk`,
        which is part of the sources in the tarball, before building the
        application.
-   And in an attempt to extract something positive from the issue, we
    are going to review an additional [unfortunate
    change](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/1eb437784021521d57ae96980bf447e9162d4415)
    I made on `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`
-   To figure out the checksum for the tarball you have the
    `nix-prefetch-url` utility. In addition to returning the *sha256
    checksum* it will also leave the downloaded blob on your *nix
    store*, thus avoiding additional downloads when you test the build
    process. You get the path to the downloaded blob and the *sha256sum*
    on the last two lines of the command's output:

<!-- -->

    get some *git* documentation if you need:

Testing the changes
-------------------

-   The changes made to these *nix expressions* are affecting the build
    process and therefore the behavior of the resulting binaries,
    configuration and other support files (man pages, scripts, etc.).
    Additionally there might be other packages or system services that
    depend on the ones we are altering, so these changes should be
    carefully considered, reviewed and thoroughly tested before they can
    be submitted and accepted on the official nixpkgs repository.
-   The worst case scenario is that a lot of people will get a broken
    package (or a broken system, even unable to boot) if the changes
    have unexpected side effects or if the changes are wrong and are
    reviewed too lightly. In special this happens more often for
    architectures other than 32 and 64-bit x86, because these are not so
    popular and thus less known and tested.
-   If your current directory is, as we said, `~/devel/nixpkgs/`, you
    can request nix to build the modified package (see `man nix-build`):

<!-- -->

    nix-build -A i3

-   Alternatively, you can request nix to build from expressions on an
    specific directory (`-f .`)and then to update your user environment
    so you will have the newly built binaries, man pages etc. available
    at hand for testing (see `man nix-env`):

<!-- -->

    nix-env -f . -iA i3

-   In these two invocations the `i3` in `-A i3` refers to
    `i3 = callPackage ...` in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`. In the
    same way as the `pango` we talked about above, both names are
    attributes from the top-level Nix expression being evaluated. In
    this case `~/devel/nixpkgs/default.nix`
-   Here I would have detected the error I introduced on
    `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`. Too bad I didn't still know how
    to test my changes:

<!-- -->

    $ nix-build -A i3
    error: function at `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix:1:1' called with unexpected argument
    (use `--show-trace' to show detailed location information)

-   Let's follow the advice by adding `--show-trace` to the `nix-build`
    invocation:

<!-- -->

    $ nix-build --show-trace -A i3 
    error: while evaluating the function at `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/lib/customisation.nix:98:35':
    while evaluating the function at `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/lib/customisation.nix:59:24':
    while evaluating the builtin function `isAttrs':
    function at `~/devel/nixpkgs/pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix:1:1' called with unexpected argument

-   Not that I got any more clues from this extra step. But it turned
    out that there is no mention to `cairo` on
    `pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix` so it was illegal
    to invoke the `cairo.override ...` thing inside the
    `i3 = callPackage ...` on `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`:

<!-- -->

    i3 = callPackage ../applications/window-managers/i3 {
        cairo = cairo.override { xcbSupport = true; }; # WRONG!
      };

-   So I would have reverted my changes to
    `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`. Take care with this command as it
    is quite eager to undo your changes. But that's out of scope here.
    See some *git* documentation:

<!-- -->

    git checkout pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix

-   Now let's try again:

<!-- -->

    $ nix-build -A i3
    /nix/store/agld76p9rgvn3j610z8kgppz67f8kmg7-i3-4.5.1

-   When the build succeeds, `nix-build` will leave the result linked as
    `./result` on the current working directory:

<!-- -->

    $ stat ./result | head -n 1
      File: "./result" -> "/nix/store/agld76p9rgvn3j610z8kgppz67f8kmg7-i3-4.5.1"

-   If convenient, you can review and fiddle with the resulting stuff:

<!-- -->

    $ find result/ -type f
    result/include/i3/ipc.h
    result/bin/i3-input
    result/bin/i3-nagbar
    result/bin/i3-msg
    result/bin/i3-migrate-config-to-v4
    result/bin/i3-sensible-terminal
    result/bin/i3-sensible-pager
    result/bin/i3-sensible-editor
    result/bin/i3bar
    result/bin/i3
    result/bin/i3-config-wizard
    result/bin/i3-dmenu-desktop
    result/bin/i3-dump-log
    result/etc/i3/config.keycodes
    result/etc/i3/config
    result/share/xsessions/i3.desktop
    result/share/applications/i3.desktop

-   And for some real-life testing we would invoke `nix-env` as
    explained above:

<!-- -->

    $ nix-env -f . -iA i3
    replacing old `i3-4.5.1'
    installing `i3-4.5.1'
    building path(s) `/nix/store/49ag28h77sjmg3rygpsm83jxkhn5jzyn-user-environment'
    created 2006 symlinks in user environment

-   You might double-check that the binaries on `$PATH` are indeed the
    new ones:

<!-- -->

     stat `type -P i3` | head -n 1
      File: "~/.nix-profile/bin/i3" -> "/nix/store/agld76p9rgvn3j610z8kgppz67f8kmg7-i3-4.5.1/bin/i3"

-   It is quite annoying to test a window manager, `i3` in special as
    [it does not implement the `--replace`
    feature](http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/536).
-   And sometimes there are lots of other tricky possibilities. For
    example `i3` invokes other binaries from the same package, such as
    `i3bar`. I lost a great deal of time trying to figure out why the
    *i3 status bar* was refusing to render *pango fonts*. That was
    because I was launching `~/devel/nixpkgs/result/bin/i3` instead of
    having the whole package replaced on my *nix user environment*. And
    the old `i3bar` from the *nix store* was on my `$PATH`. Obviously
    that was before I learned the `nix-env` invocation shown above.

Pushing the local changes to GitHub
-----------------------------------

### Committing to the local repository

-   The first step is to commit your local changes to the local
    repository.
-   A quick overview of the affected stuff:

<!-- -->

    $ git status
    # On branch example
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       modified:   pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix
    #       modified:   pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix
    #
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

-   As we have just seen, you can review the pending changes with
    `git diff`
-   You can limit the scope to review piece by piece:

<!-- -->

    $ git diff pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix
    diff --git a/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix b/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix
    index 0d3e4cc..a1c0d4b 100644

-   These changes were made with two different purposes. I don't like
    commits mixing unrelated changes. It turns out that git can help
    here saving a lot of time and potential human error:
    `git commit --patch pkgs/applications/window-managers/i3/default.nix`.
-   *git* will sequentially show "groups of changes" (it calls them
    *hunks*). For each *hunk* we are asked what we want to do; we can do
    several things than are displayed by typing a question mark. I will
    explain with my words the ones we are interested in right now.
    Obviously the explanation given by git prevails:
    -   type `y` to include the changes on this hunk in the commit
    -   type `n` to leave the changes on this hunk out of this commit
    -   type `s` to split the hunk if it consists of unrelated changes.
        You are then asked again about the smaller hunks.
-   Note that this command is not destructive. Changes left out of the
    commit are not discarded.
-   So I will do a first commit with all changes related to enabling
    pango support for i3. Please note how I explain git to `s` split the
    big hunk, `y` include the first small hunk on the commit, `n` skip
    the second hunk, `n` skip the third hunk, `y` and `y` to include the
    last two hunks:

### Pushing to GitHub

-   Now we want to push the local commits to our clone of NixOS/nixpkgs
    at GitHub:
