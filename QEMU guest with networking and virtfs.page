Introduction
------------

This article describes how to run a QEMU guest with full networking and
VirtFS support. VirtFS (Plan 9 folder sharing over Virtio - I/O
virtualization framework) allows you to mount folders from the host
system on the guest system, this is significantly faster than folder
sharing over the network e.g. NFS.

Enable kernel modules
---------------------

The NixOS install process will typically enable the relevant kvm modules
for your system (kvm-amd or kvm-intel) in hardware-configuration.nix ().
You can also add "tun" and "virtio" if you wish to use the networking
setup described below.

    boot.kernelModules = [ "kvm-amd" "tun" "virtio" ];

You can check for the existence of /dev/kvm after rebooting. You may
also need to enable hardware virtualization in your BIOS or similar.

Prepare a guest image
---------------------

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 /mnt/OSImages/mint.qcow2 5G
    qemu-kvm -m 1024 -drive file=/mnt/OSImages/mint.qcow2  -cdrom /mnt/OSImages/mint-livecd.iso -boot d

The default amount of memory available to the guest is 128MB so you will
probably want to specify something more than that with the "m" flag. By
default the guest will have access to the network so you can install the
OS at this stage if you like.

Alternatively you can download a QEMU image with an OS already installed
e.g. Debian: <http://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/>

    qemu-kvm -m 1024 -drive file=/mnt/OSImages/debian_squeeze_amd64_standard.qcow2

Prepare host network
--------------------

There are a number of options to enable access to the guest OS from the
host, using [VDE](http://vde.sourceforge.net/) (Virtual Distributed
Ethernet) is probably the easiest and most versatile.

As root add a "kvm" group so that you only have to do the networking
setup as root:

    # groupadd kvm
    # usermod -G kvm username

To change the groups of the user without logging out and back in again
(as username):

    $ su username -

Start the vde daemon (as root):

    # vde_switch -tap tap0 -mod 660 -group kvm -daemon
    # ip addr add 10.0.2.1/24 dev tap0
    # ip link set dev tap0 up

You should now see the tap0 interface with \`ip addr\`/\`ifconfig\` and
it should have been assigned the IP address specified. It is important
that you don't use the same subnet as your host network interface
(eth0/wlan0) is using.

Forward traffic:

    # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.2.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

TODO: Add detail on how to configure this using NixOS

Guest network config
--------------------

You can now start the VM as a normal user by adding the following
options \`-net nic,model=virtio -net vde\`:

    qemu-kvm -m 1024 -net nic,model=virtio -net vde -drive file=/mnt/OSImages/debian_squeeze_amd64_standard.qcow2

Within the VM you can setup the network:

    root@guest# ip addr add 10.0.2.100/24 dev eth0
    root@guest# ip link set dev eth0 up
    root@guest# ip route add default via 10.0.2.1
    root@guest# echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' >> /etc/resolv.conf

You can now access this VM on 10.0.2.100

VirtFS
------

VirtFS enables folders to be shared between the host and guest very
efficiently. Some extra qemu options are required:

    qemu-kvm -m 1024 -net nic,model=virtio -net vde -drive file=/mnt/OSImages/debian_squeeze_amd64_standard.qcow2,if=virtio -virtfs local,path=/home/username/shared/,security_model=passthrough,mount_tag=host_share

This will share /home/username/shared on the host with the guest,
passing through permissions. See the [QEMU
wiki](http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup) for more details.

To mount this on the guest:

    mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio host_share /mnt/host_share -oversion=9p2000.L

Tips
----

### Shortcuts

Reset the size of the QEMU window: ctrl-alt-u

### Snapshots

You can save the current state of the VM (including the CPU state) and
then load it later.

1.  Enter the QEMU monitor with ctrl-alt-2
2.  savevm snap1
3.  Return to the QEMU VM with ctrl-alt-1
4.  Do something noticable: \`ls /\`
5.  Return to the QEMU monitor and \`savevm snap2\`
6.  Load snap1 \`loadvm snap1\`

You can also load the snapshot directly from the command line:

    qemu-kvm -m 1024 -net nic,model=virtio -net vde -drive file=/mnt/OSImages/debian_squeeze_amd64_standard.qcow2,if=virtio -virtfs local,path=/home/username/shared/,security_model=passthrough,mount_tag=host_share -loadvm snap1
