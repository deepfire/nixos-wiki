NixOS module has declarations to provide an interface for other modules.
Option declarations are used to make NixOS aware of configuration
possibilities or to hide the complexity of configuration. Option
declarations are used to provide an interface over the inherent
complexity of configuring the system.

Option attributes
=================

Options are declared with the `mkOption` function which is provided by
the Nix package collection library (`pkgs.lib` attribute set). An option
declaration may contain the following attributes:

-   `name` `(string)`: This attribute is by default set to the location
    of the option. The name is used in error messages and in the
    generated manual.
-   `default` `('t)`: The value used when no definitions are provided.
-   `example` `('t)`: The value used as example to show a possible
    configuration.
-   `description` `(string)`: A multi-line text which describe in a few
    sentences what is achieved by the option.
-   `type` `(/'t/)`: The expected type of the default value and the
    option definitions. The type may provide default code for `merge`
    and `check` attribute.
-   `merge` `('t list -> 't)`: A function used to merge all definitions
    into one result which has the same type.
-   `apply` `('t -> any)`: A function used to provide an abstraction
    over the merged result. This function is mostly used when an usual
    transformation is made of the result.
-   `options` `(module list)`: This attribute contains a list of modules
    when the type allow to have embedded modules.

An option can be declared in multiple modules, with one condition which
is that no attribute collisions exists between the declarations except
for the `options` attribute.

Evaluation
----------

The evaluation is done with the following piece of code where `opt` is
the option declaration. You can find this piece of code inside
[`pkgs/lib/modules.nix`](https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/lib/modules.nix%7C).

      opt.apply (
        if isNotDefined then
          if opt ? default then opt.default
          else throw "Not defined."
        else opt.merge definitions
      )

The `apply` function is replaced by the identity function and the
`merge` function is replaced by the `mergeDefaultOption` function if
they are not defined.
