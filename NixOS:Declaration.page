NixOS module has declarations to provide an interface for other modules.
Option declarations are used to make NixOS aware of configuration
possibilities or to hide the complexity of configuration. Option
declarations are used to provide an interface over the inherent
complexity of configuring the system.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Option attributes")] Option attributes
========================================================================================================================

Options are declared with the `mkOption` function which is provided by
the Nix package collection library (`pkgs.lib` attribute set). An option
declaration may contain the following attributes:

-   `name` `(string)`: This attribute is by default set to the location
    of the option. The name is used in error messages and in the
    generated manual.
-   `default` `('t)`: The value used when no definitions are provided.
-   `example` `('t)`: The value used as example to show a possible
    configuration.
-   `description` `(string)`: A multi-line text which describe in a few
    sentences what is achieved by the option.
-   `type` `(/'t/)`: The expected type of the default value and the
    option definitions. The type may provide default code for `merge`
    and `check` attribute.
-   `merge` `('t list -> 't)`: A function used to merge all definitions
    into one result which has the same type.
-   `apply` `('t -> any)`: A function used to provide an abstraction
    over the merged result. This function is mostly used when an usual
    transformation is made of the result.
-   `options` `(module list)`: This attribute contains a list of modules
    when the type allow to have embedded modules.

An option can be declared in multiple modules, with one condition which
is that no attribute collisions exists between the declarations except
for the `options` attribute.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Evaluation")] Evaluation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The evaluation is done with the following piece of code where `opt` is
the option declaration. You can find this piece of code inside
[`pkgs/lib/modules.nix`](https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/lib/modules.nix%7C).

      opt.apply (
        if isNotDefined then
          if opt ? default then opt.default
          else throw "Not defined."
        else opt.merge definitions
      )

The `apply` function is replaced by the identity function and the
`merge` function is replaced by the `mergeDefaultOption` function if
they are not defined.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Types")] Types
================================================================================================

Types are used to ensure the correctness of definitions and to provide a
way to merge the definitions. All common types are available in
[`pkgs/lib/types.nix`](https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/lib/types.nix%7C).
To declare a type you have to write something like:

    services.fooBar.option = pkgs.lib.mkOption {
      type = with pkgs.lib.types; uniq string;
      description = "
        ...
      ";
    };

The `check` function provided by the type can be a source of strictness,
but this is rare because most of the time checked option definitions are
fully used by the merge function.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Simple Types")] Simple Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   `inferred`: Useful when it is used under a meta-type.
-   `bool`: A Boolean useful for enable flags. The merge function is a
    logical OR between all definitions.
-   `int`: An Integer.
-   `string`: A string where all definitions are concatenated.
-   `envVar`: A string where all definitions are concatenated with a
    colon between all definitions.
-   `attrs`: An attribute set. (you should prefer `attrsOf inferred`)
-   `package`: A derivation.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Meta Types")] Meta Types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data meta-types:

-   `listOf t`: A list of elements with the type `t`.
-   `attrsOf t`: An attribute set of elements with the type `t`. The
    merge function zip all attribute sets into one. Attribute values of
    the resulting attribute set are merged with the merge function of
    the type `t`.

Definition meta-types:

-   `uniq t`: This type define raise an error if more than one
    definitions exists. All other properties are inherited from the type
    `t`. This is useful to avoid ambiguous definitions.
-   `none t`: This type define raise an error if at least one
    definitions exists. All other properties are inherited from the type
    `t`. This is useful to provide a computation result to other
    modules. See also the `apply` function of option declarations.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NixOS:Declaration&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Module Type")] Module Type
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   `optionSet`: This type is used to benefit from the modular system
    used by NixOS inside an option. When this type is enabled, it merge
    the `options` attribute of option declarations with each definition.
    The result is the fixed configuration of each module. This option is
    often see in conjunction with `attrsOf` or `listOf`. Modules
    declared in option declaration appear in the generated manual with a
    prefix representing the container type, respectively "`.<name>`" and
    "`.*`". Reference to definition files do not appears in the
    generated manual because the system cannot track them.
