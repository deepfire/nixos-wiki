-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TopGit is used to manage a set of patches on top of upstream branches.
Those patches are usually referred to as "topics" because each branch is
created to implement a small story. Such a topic-branch will end up as
being one commit later. There are alternative solutions such as quilt,
stgit. Note: Mercurial and others have similar extensions AFAIK. In
contrast to keeping piles of patches TopGit is collaborative. This means
you and others can work on a topic on different machines easily until
you feel the patch is ready - maybe this never happens. Because its
collaborative TopGit was designed to follow branches upstream only.
WARNING: Going back to a previous state is possible but very hard. So if
you don't know what will happen at the beginning you may want to backup
your repository. You only mess up the TopGit branches which can be
deleted and recreated though.

So how does TopGit work?

TopGit adds two files: .topmsg and .topdeps The first file contains a
description of the topic. The second tells TopGit about how to follow
upstream. (On which branches does this topc depend upon) .topmsg will be
end up being the commit message when exporting the topic and feeding it
upstream. Its good practise starting all TopGit branches with t/ or tg/.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usually you follow upstream. Eg ` `

     # create a topic branch
     git checkout -b MY_BRANCH
     # hack and commit two times
     git commit -am 'first change H1'
     git commit -am 'next change H2'

     # follow upstream by updating master, then merging master into MY_BRANCH
     git checkout master; git pull;
     git checkout MY_BRANCH; git merge master

This last step merging with master is very important. It ensures that
your patche(s) doesn't drift away too much. However it pollutes history
a little bit.

So development usually looks like this after some time: (\* denotes a
merging trunk into MY\_BRANCH). `  `

     X -  X - A   - B   -   C   -    D -  [master]
           ` H1 - H2 `*  - H3 ` * -  [MY_BRANCH]

Simple speaking: TopGit automates this task for you:

perquisites: install git and gitAndTools.topGit

` `

     TopGit create tg/MY_BRANCH
     # give a description of this topic branch.
     $EDITOR .topmsg
     git add .topmsg
     git commit

     # work on the topic branch:
     # HACK ..
     git commit -am 'initial not very well tested version ..'

     # update with upstream:
     tg update

     # change message
     $EDITOR .topmsg
     git commit -am 'changing topic message'

     # export topic(s) to branch
     tg export [--linearize] test-export

     # export topic(s) to patch seriees:
     tg export --quilt DIRECTORY

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course if you would only track a simple topic you would not start
using TopGit. topics can depend on others:

` `

     tg create tg/adding-new-bulider; # edit .topmsg and commit
     tg create tg/adding-package-depending-on-new-builder# edit .topmsg and commit.
     git checkout tg/adding-new-bulider; 
     # HACK X
     git commit -m 'message is not that important. .topmsg will be used anyway..'
     git checkout tg/adding-package-depending-on-new-builder
     tg update # merge HACK X updates into this topic-branch

Now our topic tree looks like this: ` `

     msater
       `- tg/adding-new-bulider
        ` - tg/adding-package-depending-on-new-builder

You'd use tgs summary --graphviz feature to create this graph: ` `

     dotty <( tg summary --graphviz)

Using tg depend add BRANHCH\_NAME you can make a topic depend on
multiple upstream branches or other topics.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each topic branch existst of two branches: a merge base tracking
dependencies and the topic branch. When running tg update TopGit first
merges the base with all dependencies. Then it merges the topic-branch
into this base. Because each topic branch has a base and because each
topic may have multiple dependencies its hard to undo an operation. So
you understand my warning now :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

` `

     # get all merge bases and topic branches:
     tg remote origin --populate

     # push a topic (and its dependencies) to a remote git repository:
     tg push -r origin t/branch-name

Workflow: ` `

     tg remote origin --populate # update remote branches
     tg update # update dependencies, then merge base with deps, then merge topic branch and its base.
     # HACK
     git commit -m 'more work has been done'
     tg push -r origin t/this-topic-branch

Of course when running tg update you run the risk to get merge trouble
even if there are no conflicts. I think git folks just live with it.
They fix the failure and do a new commit. Commits will be squashed when
exporting TopGit branches anyway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If different users work on a topic the information will be lost who did
what because one branch will be collapsed. Best we can do is adding to
the .topmsg file ` `

     message
     work done by name, name, name

You never know what others will add after your work. So signing off a
commit too early can be risky. (I hope that communication is fine that
contributers talk before feeding such a topic upstream - So this is not
a problem)

I use these bash functions to speed exporting a topic branch up and
creating new ones: ` `

     # create new topic branch and open editor, commit .topmsg file
     tgCreate () {
             tg create "$@" || {
                     echo 'failure, starting subshell'
                     $SHELL
             }
             $EDITOR .topmsg
             git add .topmsg
             git commit -m "new tg branch $1"
     }

     # export checked out topic branch to export/BRANCH_NAME assuming the topic was
     # prefixed by t/
     tgExport () {
             local branch=$(cat .git/HEAD |  sed 's@ref: refs/heads/\(t/\)\?\(.*\)@\2@')
             local prefix=export/
             local exported=${prefix}$branch
             git branch -D $exported
             tg export "$@" $exported
     }
